== Description

This is a thorough guide about fixing and enhancing _Fallout 3 Game of the Year Edition_, that is, _Fallout 3_ and all its DLCs, using http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1334/?[Mod Organizer] to keep track of all the mods installed. It replaces completely the https://github.com/pcesarperez/Modding-never-changes[first volume], which should be considered obsolete.

[NOTE]
====
There are https://github.com/pcesarperez/Modding-never-changes-vol-2/wiki[a number of wiki pages] to get an in-depth feeling of things related to this guide, like https://github.com/pcesarperez/Modding-never-changes-vol-2/wiki/Changelog[the changelog] or https://github.com/pcesarperez/Modding-never-changes-vol-2/wiki/Roadmap[the roadmap]. You can even https://github.com/pcesarperez/Modding-never-changes-vol-2/wiki/How-to-compile-the-book[build the guide for yourself].

== Installation

You can compile the Asciidoc source using the provided script (`build-doc`), as https://github.com/pcesarperez/Modding-never-changes-vol-2/wiki/How-to-compile-the-book[pointed out in the wiki]. Alternatively, you can download the https://github.com/pcesarperez/modding-never-changes-vol-2/releases[current compiled snapshot].

Anyway, there is a certain sense of elation when you go from this:

.Sublime Text workspace

To this:

.HTML version of the book
image::HTML%20version%20of%20the%20book.png[HTML version of the book]

As you can see, I am using the awesome https://www.sublimetext.com[Sublime Text] with the https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Asciidoctor[Asciidoctor] package to provide syntax highlighting.
