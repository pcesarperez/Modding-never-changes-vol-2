== Appendix 1: How to create your own merged patch

If you have a lot of time to spare, you feel somewhat masochist or you are giving me a big middle finger while you decide that you will install pretty much the fucking mods you like, you need to create your own merged patch.

Gopher has a video (39:12) in which he explains https://youtu.be/uPK7R71zcwM?t=14m5s[what is a merged patch and why we should use it]. Cal, from Dirty Weasel, also has a video (32:06) explaining https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLWMvEg2LxwXYgN9UIEFAEGxfmT5ondfIi&v=v3tPQKDStTc[how to create merged and bashed patches for _Fallout New Vegas_], although the process is very similar in _Fallout 3_.

Take into account that a merged patch is not a magic fix. There could be little inconsistencies across all the plugins used to create the merged patch, inconsistencies you should address one by one, at least hypothetically. That is not the case with the provided merged patches at the end of each major DEFCON chapter, which are shiny, polished and full of glamour!

The process to create a merged patch is pretty straightforward.

. Open MO in your desired profile.
. Disable any merged or bashed patch you have previously created. This is very important because merged and bashed patches are not cumulative. You have to create a new one for each profile where applicable.
+
.Disabling previous merged and bashed patches

. Launch xEdit using the toolbar button which creation is lost in the mists of time.
+
.Launching xEdit through the toolbar button
image::Appendix-1-Mod-Organizer-xEdit-toolbar-button.png["Launching xEdit through the toolbar button", title="Launching xEdit through the toolbar button"]
. Select all the files in your load order, *except any merged or bashed patch* (you should have disabled them first, anyway).
+
.Selecting all the plugins to create a merged patch
image::Appendix-1-xEdit-selecting-all-files-to-create-merged-patch.png["Selecting all the plugins to create a merged patch", title="Selecting all the plugins to create a merged patch"]
. xEdit takes its time to load all the plugins, so you'd better go and fix yourself a strong-spirited beverage in the meantime. Look for a message in the right pane which says "Background Loader: finished" to know when to stop fixing yourself drinks.
+
.xEdit has loaded all your plugins
image::Appendix-1-xEdit-finished-loading-all-plugins.png["xEdit has loaded all your plugins", title="xEdit has loaded all your plugins"]
. Right-click anywhere in the left pane and select *Other* -> *Create Merged Patch*.
+
.Option to create a merged patch in xEdit
image::Appendix-1-xEdit-create-merged-patch-option.png["Option to create a merged patch in xEdit", title="Option to create a merged patch in xEdit"]
. xEdit shows a window in which you can give a name to your merged patch. I'd recommend using the name of the DEFCON profile you are generating the patch for to easily identify it. After giving the patch a meaningful name, click on *OK*.
+
.Giving a name to your merged patch
image::Appendix-1-xEdit-giving-a-name-to-your-merged-patch.png["Giving a name to your merged patch", title="Giving a name to your merged patch"]
. That's it! Our new and great-looking merged patch has been created.
+
.Merged patch created
image::Appendix-1-xEdit-merged-patch-created.png["Merged patch created", title="Merged patch created"]
. It's time to save the merged patch, so exit xEdit for it to show the window with the list of created or modified files. Make sure the patch is selected and the option *Backup plugins* is not and click on *OK*.
+
.xEdit wants to save the merged patch
image::Appendix-1-xEdit-saving-merged-patch.png["xEdit wants to save the merged patch", title="xEdit wants to save the merged patch"]
. It's time to get back to MO, but... Where is my merged patch? The only indication that something has changed is the warning icon in the toolbar.
+
.Where the fuck is my merged patch?
image::Appendix-1-Mod-Organizer-where-is-my-merged-patch.png["Where the fuck is my merged patch?", title="Where the fuck is my merged patch?"]
. Generally speaking, every time you create a file in MO, it goes to the *Overwrite* special folder. Double-click on it to show its contents, at the bottom of the left pane.
+
.There is something lurking in our 'Overwrite' folder
image::Appendix-1-Mod-Organizer-there-is-something-lurking-in-overwrite.png["There is something lurking in our 'Overwrite' folder", title="There is something lurking in our 'Overwrite' folder"]
. The overwrite folder contains two elements: our merged patch and a folder named `FO3Edit Backups`, which is created every time we exit from xEdit, although we chose not to create any backup copy (it's just a minor glitch). Get rid of the folder by right-clicking on it and selecting *Delete*.
+
.Isolating the merged patch in the 'Overwrite' folder
image::Appendix-1-Mod-Organizer-isolating-merged-patch-in-overwrite.png["Isolating the merged patch in the 'Overwrite' folder", title="Isolating the merged patch in the 'Overwrite' folder"]
. Our merged patch sits alone in the *Overwrite* folder. Time to close the window.
+
.The merged patch is isolated in the 'Overwrite' folder
image::Appendix-1-Mod-Organizer-merged-patch-isolated.png["The merged patch is isolated in the 'Overwrite' folder", title="The merged patch is isolated in the 'Overwrite' folder"]
. Back to the MO main window, right-click on the *Overwrite* entry in the left pane and select *Create Mod...*.
+
.Option to create a new mod from the contents of the 'Overwrite' folder
image::Appendix-1-Mod-Organizer-creating-merged-patch-mod-option.png["Option to create a new mod from the contents of the 'Overwrite' folder", title="Option to create a new mod from the contents of the 'Overwrite' folder"]
. In the following window, give the merged patch mod the same name we gave to the `.esp` file in xEdit and click on *OK*.
+
.Giving a meaningful name to our merged patch mod
image::Appendix-1-Mod-Organizer-naming-the-merged-patch-mod.png["Giving a meaningful name to our merged patch mod", title="Giving a meaningful name to our merged patch mod"]
. Now, you just have to activate the mod in the left pane.
+
.The merged patch is activated
image::Appendix-1-Mod-Organizer-merged-patch-activated.png["The merged patch is activated", title="The merged patch is activated"]
. Although the position of the mod in the left pane is not really important, the plugin should *ALWAYS* sit at the bottom of your load order (again, above the bashed patch). Take a look at the *Plugins* tab in the right pane.
+
.The merged patch plugin sits at the bottom of your load order
