=== Installing the game

I am assuming we are using the Steam edition of _Fallout 3 Game of the Year Edition_, with all 5 DLCs. This is what you have to do first and foremost.

. Install Steam outside UAC-controlled space. In other words, *DO NOT* install Steam in the default location, under `[C:\Program Files]`. Install it instead in `[C:\Games]` or any other location of your choice. If you have Steam already installed in UAC-controlled space, check this guide about https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7418-YUBN-8129[moving a Steam installation and games]. We will refer to the final Steam location as `[%STEAM_HOME%]`.
. Install _Fallout 3 Game of the Year Edition_ through Steam. The game will be located at `[%STEAM_HOME%\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty]`, which we will refer to as `[%FO3_HOME%]` from now on.
. You *MUST* run the game at least once to create the configuration files the game needs, so double-click on the launcher icon you should have in your desktop.

. The launcher dutifully informs you that video hardware is about to be detected, thus setting up the configuration for you.

. After a brief moment, the launcher shows a message with the quality settings it has detected for your box.

. Click on *Options* to adjust the video resolution (mine is 1680Ã—1050; your mileage may vary). Don't bother changing anything else right now.

. You will probably run into an error like this one when trying to run the game for the first time, at least under Windows 10 Creators Update (if not, jump ahead to step 14). To fix this, click on *Learn more* to open a browser window and download the Games for Windows Live client from Microsoft.

. Install the client running the `gfwlivesetup.exe` file you just downloaded. The installation will be brief.

. Try to run the game again. The dreaded compatibility assistant shows itself again. However, this time tick the option *Don't show this message again* and then click on *Close*.

. This is all we need, for now. Just click on *Quit* and check this files and folders under `[%USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Games\Fallout3]` (`[%USERPROFILE%\My Documents\My Games\Fallout3]`, if you are using Windows 7):
* `[Saves]`
* `FALLOUT3.INI`
* `FalloutPrefs.ini`
* `RendererInfo.txt`
