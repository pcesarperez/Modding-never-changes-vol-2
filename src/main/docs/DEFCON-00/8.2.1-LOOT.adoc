==== LOOT

https://loot.github.io/[Load Order Optimisation Tool] (LOOT) is a tool used to take care of the load order in Bethesda's games (_Fallout_ series and _The Elder Scrolls_ series). Mod Organizer comes with an integrated version of LOOT, but it is outdated, so we are going to need the standalone version installed.

[TIP]

If you want to have an in-depth look to LOOT and what it can do, just watch the https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I35nNK8PWlw[Start to Finish tutorial about LOOT], by GamerPoets.

. https://loot.github.io/[Download] and install LOOT outside UAC-controlled space (for example, `[C:\Games\Tools\LOOT]`; never under `[C:\Program files]`). We will refer to the installation folder as `[%LOOT_HOME%]`.
. Run LOOT after installing it. When it is run for the first time, a window will appear with some tips. Just click *OK* to dismiss it.

. LOOT usually does a good job detecting the installed games which it considers manageable, so there is a good chance that _Fallout 3_ would be automatically detected.

. *DON'T DO ANYTHING BUT EXIT LOOT!* We are going to manage the load order through Mod Organizer, so this will be the last time we run LOOT standalone.
