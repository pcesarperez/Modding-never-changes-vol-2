==== Creating a proper shortcut

We need a shortcut to MO to run the tool with ease, because we are going to launch the game using MO, _with no exceptions_. It may seem a bit overkill at first, at least when you have the game fully modded, but trust me, you would like to know exactly which profile, and therefore which mods, are you going to load.

. Navigate with windows Explorer to `[%FO3_HOME%\Mod Organizer]` and grab `Mod Organizer.exe` with the right mouse button, dropping it in your desktop, then selecting *Create shortcuts here*.

. Rename the shortcut to something meaningful, like "FO3-MO", for example. We are planning for the future again, because we could be using Mod Organizer for _Fallout New Vegas_ and _The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion_, among others.

. The default icon for MO is not that bad, but now we are customizing our environment, why stop here? Let's change the icon to show the game we are dealing with.

. Right-click on the MO icon and select *Properties*. Don't pay attention to the shitload of options I have in my contextual menu. Your mileage may vary.
