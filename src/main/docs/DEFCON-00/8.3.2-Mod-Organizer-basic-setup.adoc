==== Mod Organizer basic setup

By now, we have everything in place, but we have not started with the real deal yet. Let's begin now.

. Launch MO with the shortcut we have just created. You can see the https://wiki.step-project.com/Guide:Mod_Organizer#Left_Pane[left pane] and the https://wiki.step-project.com/Guide:Mod_Organizer#Right_Pane[right pane]. The left pane contains our mod stack, sorted by priority (the higher the number, the higher the priority), while the right pane contains our load order, also sorted by priority, with just the `.esm` and `.esp` files (the Vanilla version comes with no `.esp` files, though).

. There is something a bit off with the information shown in both panes: the order is not right. Somehow, MO does not know how to sort the main file and official DLCs right off the hook. Let's start by correcting the priority order in the left pane by dragging and dropping the official mods until you have this:
  * Unmanaged: Fallout3
  * Unmanaged: Anchorage
  * Unmanaged: ThePitt
  * Unmanaged: BrokenSteel
  * Unmanaged: PointLookout
  * Unmanaged: Zeta

. Do the same with the load order in the right pane, dragging and dropping the plugins. You should have this:
  * `Fallout3.esm` (you cannot move this, anyway)
  * `Anchorage.esm`
  * `ThePitt.esm`
  * `BrokenSteel.esm`
  * `PointLookout.esm`
  * `Zeta.esm`

. We are working with the default profile, so we are going to rename it to show we are working with the Vanilla, unmodded game. Click on the profiles button which lies in the left-hand side of the toolbar.
+
.Mod Organizer profiles button

. In the profiles management window, select the "Default" profile and click on *Rename*.
+

. Rename the profile to "DEFCON 00 (Vanilla)" and click *OK*.

.Renamed Vanilla profile in Mod Organizer

. Back to the profiles management window, activate the option *Automatic Archive Invalidation*. Otherwise, you won't be able to install any mod! Finally, click on *Close*.
+

. You can see the renamed profile in the dropdown just below the toolbar, above the priority list.
+
.Mod Organizer Vanilla profile
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-Vanilla-profile.png["Mod Organizer Vanilla profile", title="Mod Organizer Vanilla profile"]
. Switch to the *Archives* tab in the right pane and make sure the option *Have MO manage archives* is activated and the file `Fallout - Invalidation.bsa` is at the top (if it is not, don't worry, we'll fix that in a moment).
+

. Let's sift through the options we need to change. Click on the settings button at the toolbar.
+
.Mod Organizer settings button
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-settings-button.png["Mod Organizer settings button", title="Mod Organizer settings button"]
. In the *General* tab adjust at least the following settings:
  * Activate the *Advanced* option.
  * If possible, select a download directory in an alternate location, outside your `[%FO3_HOME%]` folder.
  * Activate *Download Meta Information*.
+
.Mod Organizer general settings

. In the *Nexus* tab, adjust at least the following settings:
  * Activate the *Automatic Log-In to Nexus* option.
  * Use your username and password from Nexus to authenticate.
  * Click on the *Associate with "Download with manager" links* button.
+
.Mod Organizer Nexus settings
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-Nexus-settings.png["Mod Organizer Nexus settings", title="Mod Organizer Nexus settings"]
. In the *Plugins* tab, select the plugin "BSA Extractor" and, in the right pane, switch the "enabled" status from "False" to "True".
+
.Mod Organizer plugins settings
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-plugins-settings.png["Mod Organizer plugins settings", title="Mod Organizer plugins settings"]
. In the *Workarounds* tab, disable the option *Force-enable game files*.
+
.Mod Organizer workarounds settings

. Back to the MO main window, click on the options dropdown and select *Refresh*.
+
.Mod Organizer refresh settings
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-refresh-settings.png["Mod Organizer refresh settings", title="Mod Organizer refresh settings"]
. After refreshing, you may notice a subtle change. In the *Plugins* tab of the right pane, the file `Fallout3.esm` is no longer grayed out (because we disabled the *Force-enable game files* option in the workaround settings), therefore we can drag and drop it like the rest of the files (don't do that, though).
+
.Mod Organizer main _Fallout 3_ file active
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-main-Fallout-3-file-active.png["Mod Organizer main Fallout 3 file active", title="Mod Organizer main Fallout 3 file active"]
. Remember the `Fallout - Invalidation.bsa` we mentioned before? If it was out of place, it shouldn't be grayed out now, so you can move it around.
+
.Mod Organizer invalidation file active
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-invalidation-file-active.png["Mod Organizer invalidation file active", title="Mod Organizer invalidation file active"]
. Let's check everything is alright by running the Vanilla game through MO. With the game selected in the big dropdown above the right pane (it should be selected by default), just click on the *Run* button.
+

. Mod Organizer may show a dialog about elevated privileges, although we have installed everything outside UAC-controlled space. If so, just click on *Yes* and go on.
