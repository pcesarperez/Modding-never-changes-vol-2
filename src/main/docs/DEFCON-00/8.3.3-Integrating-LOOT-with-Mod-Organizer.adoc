==== Integrating LOOT with Mod Organizer

We have a viable modding environment through MO so far, but we need to add the installed tools to the mix in order to have a full-fledged environment. The first piece will be LOOT.

. Mod Organizer does a good job detecting the previously installed LOOT, as you can see in the executables dropdown just above the right pane.

.LOOT has already been detected by Mod Organizer

. However, we have installed just one copy of LOOT, so that we can use it to manage the load order in several games. We need to instruct MO to use _Fallout 3_ in this case. Click on the executables settings button in the top bar.

. There should be only two entries in the list, one for the game itself and the other for LOOT. Select the LOOT entry and write in the *Arguments* field "--game=Fallout3", without quotations; then, click on *Modify*.

. The executables management window won't close, so click on *Close* to dismiss it.

. Back to the main window, select LOOT in the executables dropdown menu and click on *Run*.

.Select LOOT to run through Mod Organizer

. When LOOT finishes launching, notice the game tag at the top, which should say "Fallout 3". Also, notice the message "N/A: No masterlist present" in both *Masterlist Revision* and *Masterlist Date*, meaning we have yet to run the tool. Let's fix that by clicking on the sorting icon (image:DEFCON-00-LOOT-sorting-icon.png["LOOT sorting icon", title="LOOT sorting icon"]), at the top bar.

. Several things happen _very fast_.
  * A floating message appears, showing that LOOT is updating and using the masterlist to sort your plugins.

  * If you sorted the game plugins in the MO right pane like <<Mod Organizer basic setup, you have been instructed to>>, LOOT should show a message pointing out that your load order is untouched.
+
.LOOT made no changes to your load order (as it should be)

  * In the general information pane, both entries regarding the masterlist should show updated information (remember: your contents may differ).
+
.Masterlist information has been updated in LOOT
image::DEFCON-00-LOOT-masterlist-updated.png["Masterlist information has been updated in LOOT", title="Masterlist information has been updated in LOOT"]
  * All your plugins, except the main `Fallout3.esm` file, should show a warning message about dirty things FO3Edit has found and need to be cleaned up. Don't worry about them, for now. We are going to address that in the chapter about <<Cleaning up the master files, cleaning up the master files>>.

.LOOT shows the official DLC plugins are dirty

. Close LOOT to go back to the MO main window. We are going to put a shortcut in the top-right toolbar to launch LOOT effortlessly. With LOOT selected in the executables dropdown, select *Toolbar* in the *Shortcut* dropdown below the *Run* button.

. Notice the LOOT icon we have just created in the top-right toolbar. We will use this shortcut to launch LOOT from now on, leaving the executables dropdown with the game selected.
