==== Integrating xEdit with Mod Organizer

xEdit will be the next tool we are going to integrate within our modding environment. Unlike LOOT, it is not automatically detected when installed.

. Click on the executables settings button, like we did before to modify LOOT properties.

. Fill in the following fields to provide the necessary information to run xEdit and click on *Add*:
  * *Title*: "xEdit", without the quotations.
  * *Binary*: the xEdit executable path (like `$XEDIT_HOME\xEdit.exe`).
  * *Arguments*: "-FO3", without the quotations (there is http://wiki.step-project.com/Guide:XEdit#Launch_Arguments[a good bunch of command-line arguments]).

. xEdit starts loading all your data files, and it will take a bit. After it finishes, notice the following:
  * The window title says "FO3Edit", thus recognizing we are using the tool to manage _Fallout 3_ plugins.
  * The left pane contains all the plugins you selected, in the right load order.
  * The right pane should end with the message "Background Loader: finished".

. Exit xEdit and get back to the main MO window. Notice a warning sign that suddenly appears in the icon area of the top bar.

. If you click on the warning icon, a window will appear. In that window MO informs us that there are files in your http://wiki.step-project.com/Guide:Mod_Organizer#Overwrite[overwrite mod]. Click on the line showing the issue to get a full text describing what is happening. Click *Close* when you are ready to take action.

.Mod Organizer full warning contents after exiting xEdit
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-overwrite-mod-after-xEdit.png["Mod Organizer full warning contents after exiting xEdit", title="Mod Organizer full warning contents after exiting xEdit"]
. The overwrite mod is where external programs, like xEdit, put their output contents when run through MO. Double-click on the overwrite mod access in the left pane to view its contents.
+

. MO shows a window with the contents of the overwrite mod. It should have only an empty folder named `[FO3Edit Backups]` (if the folder has contents, you touched something you shouldn't in xEdit). Right-click on the folder name and select *Delete*. We don't need this folder, for now, although we are going to use the contents of this special mod in the future.

.Deleting the overwrite mod after running xEdit

. MO asks for confirmation before deleting the folder. Just click *Yes*.
+
.Mod Organizer asks for confirmation before deleting xEdit backup
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-xEdit-backup-deletion-confirmation.png["Mod Organizer asks for confirmation before deleting xEdit backup", title="Mod Organizer asks for confirmation before deleting xEdit backup"]
. MO shows back the overwrite mod contents, which should be none. Click on *Close*.
+
.Empty overwrite mod in Mod Organizer
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-empty-overwrite-mod.png["Empty overwrite mod in Mod Organizer", title="Empty overwrite mod in Mod Organizer"]
. Finally, check again the warning sign, which should be grayed out, meaning there are no contents in the overwrite mod.
