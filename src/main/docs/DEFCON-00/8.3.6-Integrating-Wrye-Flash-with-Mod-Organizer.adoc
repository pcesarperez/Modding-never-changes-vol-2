==== Integrating Wrye Flash with Mod Organizer

Wrye Flash is the final tool we need to integrate with Mod Organizer to have a full-fledged modding environment. Let's see how.

. Click on the executables settings button.

. Wrye Flash shows its main window, with the plugin list somewhat scrambled. We are going to disable the feature that prevents Wrye Flash from sorting the plugins using the right load order. In the *Mods* tab, right-click on any column in the header and uncheck the *Lock Times* options.

. Exit Wrye Flash to go back to the Mod Organizer main window, and then _launch Wrye Flash again_. This time no warning should arise. Notice the different load order the plugins have now.
