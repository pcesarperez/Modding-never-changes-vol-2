==== Integrating Wrye Flash with Mod Organizer

Wrye Flash is the final tool we need to integrate with Mod Organizer to have a full-fledged modding environment. Let's see how.

. Click on the executables settings button.

. Fill in the following fields to provide the necessary information to run Wrye Flash and click on *Add*:
  * *Title*: "Wrye Flash", without the quotations.
  * *Binary*: the Wrye Flash executable path (like `%FO3_HOME%\Mopy\Wrye Flash.exe`).

. It is possible that you get an obscure error message about Wrye Flash not being able to start at all. It that happens, just click on *Ok*. Otherwise, jump ahead to the warning about modified dates.

. The problem is not strictly related to Wrye Flash... Well, it actually is, because the program is not prepared to handle certain code pages. However, the problem arose in one of the Windows 10 updates, so the easiest solution goes through https://stackoverflow.com/a/54311750[modifying certaing locale options in Windows 10]. Perform the following steps to fix the problem.
+
.. Go to the Control Panel.
.. Select the *Region* option.

.. Navigate to the *Administrative* tab. In the pane "Language for non-Unicode programs" click on the button *Change system locale...*.

.. In the pop-up window "Region Settings", unselect *Beta: Use Unicode UTF-8 for worldwide language support*.

.. Restart the system, as requested. Wrye Flash should start now without a hitch.
. It is likely that a warning comes up about modified dates in the official data files. Just click *OK*.

. Wrye Flash shows its main window, with the plugin list somewhat scrambled. We are going to disable the feature that prevents Wrye Flash from sorting the plugins using the right load order. In the *Mods* tab, right-click on any column in the header and uncheck the *Lock Times* options.

. Exit Wrye Flash to go back to the Mod Organizer main window, and then _launch Wrye Flash again_. This time no warning should arise. Notice the different load order the plugins have now.
