=== Creating the profile

The very first thing we are going to do in each main chapter is to create the MO profile which will bind all the chapter mods together. Each *DEFCON* profile will be built upon the previous one, so *DEFCON 00* will be our foundation in this case.

. Launch MO.
. Click on the MO profiles button.

. In the following window, write "DEFCON 01 (Bug Fixes and Performance)" as the profile name and click *OK*. We will use meaningful names to easily recognize the purpose of each profile.

.Naming DEFCON 01 profile in Mod Organizer

. MO does not automatically change the profile when it is created, so click on the *Profiles* drop-down and select the "DEFCON 01 (Bug Fixes and Performance)" profile.
+
.Selecting the DEFCON 01 profile

. From now on, every operation we perform will be related to this profile.
