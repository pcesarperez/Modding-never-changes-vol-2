_Fallout 3_ crashes.

A lot.

It's a Fact of Life you have to deal with, unless you are eager to fill the pockets of your therapist.

However, we can reduce the frequency _Fallout 3_ crashes by installing a little FOSE mod which takes care of unhandled exceptions which may ruin your day. Don't let the title fool you, because the mod serves both _Fallout 3_ and _Fallout New Vegas_.

. Open MO, as usual, and switch to the *Downloads* tab in the right pane.
. http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/53635/[_NVAC - New Vegas Anti Crash_] is a _Fallout New Vegas_ mod, so we cannot download it with MO, because MO has been instructed to handle _Fallout 3_ mod downloads. Download the file [NexusFile]*NVAC - New Vegas Anti Crash* manually instead, in a location of your choice.
. Download also the file [NexusFile]*DisableProcessWindowsGhosting v2*, in the *Optional files* section.
. Now, drag & drop the file `NVAC - New Vegas Anti Crash-53635-7-5-1-0.zip` (or whatever name it has) to the *Downloads* tab in MO's right pane (yes, you can do that).

. Double-click on the mod entry in the *Downloads* tab to install it. The mod doesn't install anything in the data folder, so the installation is straightforward, without questions. Remove the installed mod from view in the *Downloads* tab.
. Activate the mod in the left pane, move it just below the unofficial patch, and we are good to go.

[NOTE]
====
In prior versions of _Mod Organizer_ you should have had to rename the virtual folder where the plugin is deployed, from `[NVSE]` (_New Vegas Script Extender_) to `[FOSE]` (_Fallout Script Extender_). It seems in MO version 1.3.11 it's no longer necessary.
====
. Drag & drop the file `DisableProcessWindowsGhosting v2-53635-2.zip` to the *Downloads* tab in MO, like we did before.

.Sideloading DisableProcessWindowsGhosting in _Mod Organizer_

. Double-click on the mod entry in the *Downloads* tab. This time, the *Install Mods* window opens without asking for manual installation first, due to the fact that the mod contains a single file in its root. There is a bunch of things that need to be addressed.
* Notice the "No game data on top level" in red, in the bottom left corner.
* This file belongs to NVAC, so we don't want it to be installed in isolation. Rename the mod to "NVAC - New Vegas Anti Crash" in the upper right corner of the window to merge both mods.
* We need to create a valid structure first, so right-click on the `<data>` element and select *Create directory...*.

.Creating the first level directory for DisableProcessWindowsGhosting
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-DisableProcessWindowsGhosting-structure-1.png["Creating the first level directory for DisableProcessWindowsGhosting", title="Creating the first level directory for DisableProcessWindowsGhosting"]
. Give the folder the name "FOSE" and click *OK*.

. MO recognizes we have a valid structure in place with the `[FOSE]` folder, but we are not done yet. Right-click on the `[FOSE]` folder this time, and select *Create directory...* again.
+
.Creating the second level directory for DisableProcessWindowsGhosting
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-DisableProcessWindowsGhosting-structure-3.png["Creating the second level directory for DisableProcessWindowsGhosting", title="Creating the second level directory for DisableProcessWindowsGhosting"]
. Give the new folder the name "Plugins" and click *OK*.
+
.Second level folder for DisableProcessWindowsGhosting
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-DisableProcessWindowsGhosting-structure-4.png["Second level folder for DisableProcessWindowsGhosting", title="Second level folder for DisableProcessWindowsGhosting"]
. Now drag and drop the file `DisableProcessWindowsGhosting.dll` from its current place, under `[<data>]`, to `[Plugins]`. We have just virtually rearranged the contents of the mod to seamlessly deploy it into the game data folder. Click *OK* to finish.
+
.Place the DisableProcessWindowsGhosting file in the right folder
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-DisableProcessWindowsGhosting-structure-5.png["Place the DisableProcessWindowsGhosting file in the right folder", title="Place the DisableProcessWindowsGhosting file in the right folder"]
. MO recognizes you are trying to merge two mods, so it shows a warning window offering several options, just in case. Click on *Merge*.
+
.Merging NVAC and DisableProcessWindowsGhosting
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-merging-NVAC-DisableProcessWindowsGhosting.png["Merging NVAC and DisableProcessWindowsGhosting", title="Merging NVAC and DisableProcessWindowsGhosting"]
. As usual, remove the mod from view in the *Downloads* pane.
. The mod "NVAC - New Vegas Anti Crash" remains in its place, in the left pane, apparently undisturbed. Double-click on it to bring up the properties window and navigate to the *Filetree* tab, where you can verify that the file `DisableProcessWindowsGhosting.dll` is in the right place, alongside `nvac.dll`. Click *Close* when you decide to stop staring at the window.

We are done! There are no visible results right now, but remember, we are hardening our game, so be patient. Wonderful things lie ahead.
