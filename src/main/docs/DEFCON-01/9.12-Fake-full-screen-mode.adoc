Bethesda's games have a tendency towards crashing when run in full-screen mode, as awkward as it sounds. Thus, the advantage in using what is called windowed borderless mode, or fake full-screen, which allows you to kbd:[Alt] + kbd:[Tab] your way out of the game anytime you wish, as well as increasing stability. The FOSE plugin we are about to install serves that purpose.

. Open MO and switch to the *Downloads* tab in the right pane.
. Download with the manager the file [NexusFile]*OneTweak for Fallout 3* from http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/21337/[_OneTweak for FO3_].
