Imagine you are playing _Fallout 3_ with your shiny new PC, burning CPU cycles like you were Donald Trump in one of his Twitter outburst sprees, and all of a sudden, something bothers you, sending chills to the bone. You don't quite know where this sensation comes from, but you are sure that something is off with your game.

Let me give it a name for you: micro-stutters. Getting right to the point, micro-stutters are little jumps perceived in the camera movement, specially when you are strafing, no matter how fluid is your game in any other regard.

Gopher explains the nature of micro-stuttering in a https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tONiXNbwSt0[good video about the game performance], and Cal from DirtyWeasel shows us https://youtu.be/T_hJY9vaN7A?t=20m40s[how to install _Fallout Stutter Remover_ using MO] to get rid of these little annoyances.
====

Let's fix that, right now.

. Open MO and switch to the *Downloads* tab in the right pane, as usual.
. Download the file [NexusFile]*FSR_4-1-36* with manager from the http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/8886/[_Fallout Stutter Remover_] page.
+
.Fallout Stutter Remover is ready to be installed

. Double-click on the mod entry in the *Downloads* tab to bring up the *Install* window. The inner structure of the mod is not quite good, so no automatic install is offered, going for full manual installation instead. There are two folders on the top level, `[Data]` and `[src]`, being of interest only the former. Right-click on it and select *Set data directory* to make that folder the root of our data hierarchy.

. Once it's done, we can see the mod inner structure is fixed, so we can just proceed by clicking on *OK*.

. FSR sits on the bottom in the left pane, as it should be. We need to tinker a little with the mod configuration before activating it, so double-click on its name.
+
.FSR is installed but not ready yet

. The mod properties window should open in the *INI-Files* tab (if not, switch to it). In the left pane, click on the only item in the *Ini Files* box (`FOSE/Plugins/sr_Fallout_Stutter_Remover.ini`) to see its contents in the right pane.
+
.FSR configuration file

. Kelmych lends us a hand in his guide to show http://wiki.step-project.com/User:Kelmych/Fallout3#Fallout_Stutter_Remover[the proper configuration we need]. We only need to modify the `FPS_Management` section (the third one in the `.ini` file), as follows.
+
----
FPS_Management = {
    bInject_iFPSClamp = 1
    fMaximumFPS = 60
    fMinimumFPS = 30
    iFPS_Report_Period = 4000
    fExtraSleepPercent = 0.05
}
----
. With the contents modified, just click on *Save* and then *Close*.
+
.FSR modified configuration file
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-FSR-modified-configuration.png["FSR modified configuration file", title="FSR modified configuration file"]
. Finally, activate the mod in the left pane and we are good to go. This is a FOSE-only mod, so there's no need to rearrange the load order. Launch the game and strafe your way around for a while to see for yourself the smoothness the game has acquired.
+
.FSR installed and active
