Let's say you have a mild case of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, and let's say that, more often than not, "mild" is a complete understatement to describe what rushes through your blood when you enter a new place in-game and you see a zillion of small pickable objects you just *NEED* to have, whatever reason you make up for it.

I have just described what I feel with this kind of games. I need to loot everything, or, at least, everything I can without stealing, unless I want my character to be a real son of a bitch (which I don't; I am a kind hearted person, after all).

The problem is that small, lootable objects in _Fallout 3_ tend to have a weird behavior regarding their position or, to be precise, their stacking. Every object has a collision mesh to establish its limits, so that when two objects collide, the game uses their collision meshes to avoid the dreaded clipping effect, and the standard collision meshes tend to extend themselves _outside_ the objects they contain.

This is the reason why you cannot neatly stack objects you have snatched without gaps between them.

The two mods we are going to install address this problem, altering the collision meshes of a lot of objects. http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/15704/[_Detailed Collisions_] fixes ordinary objects, while http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/19949/[_Precision Collision - Clutter_] fixes small, cluttering objects.
