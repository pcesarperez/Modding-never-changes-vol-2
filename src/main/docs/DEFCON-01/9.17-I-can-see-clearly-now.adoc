The Capital Wasteland in _Fallout 3_ is a dark and dirty place, and rightly so, but the developers might have been a little too enthusiastic spreading dirt all around the game. In this chapter we are going to improve the performance by getting rid of clutter and atmospheric haze which, in fact, add nothing meaningful to the game.

. Run LOOT and click on the *Sort Plugins* button to rearrange your load order. Notice how the `.esp` file has been placed between `Confessor Cromwell has a Break_EV.esp` and `DCStreet - BS.esp`. That's it! Mod installed and ready to use.
