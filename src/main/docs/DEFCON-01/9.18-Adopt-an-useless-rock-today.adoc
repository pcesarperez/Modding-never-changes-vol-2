_Fallout 3_ developers show their love for the details in every corner of the game.

In a slightly manic way.

The game engine is not rock solid, to begin with (no pun intended, I swear), but when it comes to handle zillions of useless objects for the sake of just showing you have zillions of rocks around you... Well, *NO*.

There is a mod which does something seemingly very simple: removing all unused objects from the game, improving performance. This mod is called http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/13520/[_Better Game Performance_].

Let's install this mod.

. Open MO and switch to the *Downloads* tab in the right pane.
. Download [NexusFile]*V_4* file from http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/13520/[_Better Game Performance_] with the manager.
+

. Double-click on the mod entry to bring up the Quick Install window, where you just have to select *Manual*.

+
.Better Performance default plugin location

. Run LOOT and click on the *Sort Plugins* button to rearrange your load order. Notice how the `.esp` file has been placed between `Clean-Deluxe GOTY.esp` and `DCStreet - BS.esp`. That's it! Mod installed and ready to use.
