We are using the Steam version of _Fallout 3 Game of the Year Edition_, so there's no need to use Games for Windows Live (or GfWL). Besides, GfWL may cause problems with our game, so it's better to get rid of it.

. Manually download [NexusFile]*Games for Windows LIVE Disable* from http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/1086/[_Games for Windows LIVE disabler_].
+
*DO NOT* use MO to download this tool. Download it manually instead.
. Unzip the contents of the downloaded file in a location of your choice.
. Run the file `Games for Windows LIVE Disabler.exe`.
. In the following window, just click on *Disable G4WL*.
+
.GfWL Disabler in action

. Exit GfWL.
. Launch _Fallout 3_ through MO using the *DEFCON 01* profile (you should be able to do that by now). Notice the absent *LIVE* option in the main menu screen.
