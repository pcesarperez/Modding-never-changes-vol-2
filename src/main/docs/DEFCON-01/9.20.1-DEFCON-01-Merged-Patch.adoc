==== DEFCON 01 Merged Patch

The merged patches I will provide are fine-tuned to correct any inconsistencies that the creation process may have introduced. However, remember that you need to have every mod in this DEFCON chapter installed for it to work properly.

Let's install the patch, then.

. Open MO and switch to the *Downloads* tab in the right pane.
. Download the pre-generated patch link:patches/DEFCON-01-Merged-Patch-1.0.zip[DEFCON 01 Merged Patch] in a location of your choice.
. Drag and drop the file from the folder you put it into to the *Downloads* tab in the right pane of MO.

. Double-click on the mod entry to perform an automatic installation of the mod. No *Quick Install* window will appear, because the mod is configured not to do so. The mod will appear in the left pane.

. Double-click on the mod in the left pane to show the properties window. This is not strictly necessary, but I will like to show you what the merged patch is packing. In the *Textfiles* tab, click on the file `docs/Required load order.txt` to show its contents, where you will see the required load order for this merged patch to work.

. Without leaving the *Textfiles* tab, click on the file `docs/Required stacking order.txt` to see the stacking order of the mods.

. Finally, in the *Filetree* tab, you will see the files we have just talked about, plus the well-known MO `meta.ini` file. At this point, the tour is finished, so click on *Close*.

. Now, simply activate the merged patch in the left pane and check that both the mod and its plugin file are at the bottom of their respective panes.
