==== DEFCON 01 Bashed Patch

Like merged patches, a bashed patch needs every mod I mention in the corresponding chapter installed (in the right order, besides). A bashed patch also aims at inconsistencies in the particular mix of your mod stack, adding certain advanced tweaks which are not present in merged patches.

Installing the bashed patch is very much like we did with the merged patch. Sometimes, copy-and-paste is the right way to go.

. Open MO and switch to the *Downloads* tab in the right pane.
. Download the pre-generated patch link:patches/DEFCON-01-Bashed-Patch-1.0.zip[DEFCON 01 Bashed Patch] in a location of your choice.
. Drag and drop the file from the folder you put it into to the *Downloads* tab in the right pane of MO.

. Double-click on the mod entry to perform an automatic installation of the mod. The mod is configured to be installed with no questions.

. Double-click on the mod in the left pane to show the properties window. In the *Textfiles* tab, click on the file `Docs/Required load order.txt` to show its contents, where you will see the required load order for this bashed patch to work.

. You can see there is one additional file in the *Textfiles* tab, named `docs/DEFCON 01 Bashed Patch.txt`. This file is generated by Wrye Flash while creating the bashed patch, and it comprises a summary of the creation process it underwent.

. Activate the bashed patch in the left pane and check that both the mod and its plugin file are at the bottom of their respective panes, below the merged patch. Notice the lightning with the plus sign (image:DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-lightning-plus.png["Lightning with a plus sign", title="Lightning with a plus sign"]), pointing out that the bashed patch overwrites another mod (in this case, it is overwriting the merged patch).
