You may have noticed a peculiar absence launching the game through MO: there is no Steam Overlay.

For those of you who have been living in a crab-infested cave to flee from the Steam Season Sales, Steam Overlay is, well, an overlay you can pull up in any Steam hosted game using the keys kbd:[Shift] and kbd:[Tab]. This overlay bundles an integrated browser, a chat, a recount of the time you have been playing the game and so on. I think you get the idea.

If you are interested in getting Steam Overlay back to life, follow these steps:

. Delete the icons you previously created in the desktop to launch _Fallout 3_, both of them. We are going to create a new one.
. Download manually the file [NexusFile]*FalloutLauncher* from http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/21364/[_FalloutLauncher Replacer for Steam_].
. Unzip the file `FalloutLauncher-21364-1-4.zip` (or whatever its name is, depending on the version) in a location of your choice.
. Create an empty file called `FalloutLauncher.ini` in the same folder you have just unzipped the file.
. The zipped file contained just one file, `FalloutLauncher.exe`. Run the program once, which is a console application with three options (standard launcher, FOSE and MO), to fill the INI file with a skeleton template. Just press kbd:[ESC] to exit.
+

. Open the file `FalloutLauncher.ini` for edition. There are four sections within: `[Fallout Launcher]`, `[FOSE]`, `[Mod Organizer]` and `[Custom]`. We are always going to run the game through MO, so we just need to fill in the `[Mod Organizer]` section. This is how you find that section, fresh like your first morning shit:
+
----
[Mod Organizer]
; Leave empty to ignore
Path=
Arguments=
----
. You just need to set the `Path` property to your `ModOrganizer.exe` location, which should be in `[$FO3_HOME\Mod Organizer]`. This is my version of the entry in `FalloutLauncher.ini`. Modify the `Path` entry as necessary.
+
----
[Mod Organizer]
; Leave empty to ignore
Path=C:\Games\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Mod Organizer\ModOrganizer.exe
Arguments=
----
. Now, open the folder `[$FO3_HOME]` and create a backup copy of the file `FalloutLauncher.exe`, which is the official, original launcher.
. Copy the files `FalloutLauncher.exe` and `FalloutLauncher.ini` from the FalloutLauncher Replacer folder to your `[$FO3_HOME]` folder. There should be a `FalloutReplacer.log` file which you can safely ignore. This is how the `[$FO3_HOME]` folder should look after copying the replacement.
