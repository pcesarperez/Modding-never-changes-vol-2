=== Creating the profile

The first thing we are going to do in each major chapter is to create a new profile on top of the previous one. The steps are pretty much the same that we saw in <<Creating the profile, the DEFCON 01 chapter>>, although with a subtle difference: we need to disable the merged and bashed patches we created in the preceding chapter. Failing in doing so would result in [line-through]#quantum anomalies# CTDs all over the place.
