_Fallout 3_ has a problem regarding its user interface: its huge. I think it has to do with using the same interface in the XBox and PC versions, not taking advantage of the PC capabilities.

https://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1077483-wipzbeta-darnified-ui-f3/[_DarNified UI F3_] comes to the rescue, shrinking the interface to acceptable levels, and giving us more screen real-estate to play with, which is very noticeable using the Pip-Boy, for example.

Cal, from DirtyWeasel, has a good video explaining https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLWMvEg2LxwXbtc-mZT_H9pOwhIdOcMcn9&v=9ilscW_GJ5I[how to install DarNified UI] (43:25). Gopher has a video about https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqCzCXEydwU[user interface mods] (25:05) which, although is aimed to Nexus Mod Manager users, it is useful to have a glimpse of the different in-game options of DarNified UI (from minute 7:00).

+
.Merging DUI F3 main file and hotfix
image::DEFCON-02-Mod-Organizer-merging-mods.png["Merging DUI F3 main file and hotfix", title="Merging DUI F3 main file and hotfix"]
. Move the mod in the left pane just above UIO (this is very important!) and activate it. Notice the file `DarNifiedUIF3.esp` in the bottom of the *Plugins* tab, in the right pane. There's no need to run LOOT, by the way.
+
.DUI F3 installed and active
image::DEFCON-02-Mod-Organizer-DUI-F3-active-and-ready.png["DUI F3 installed and active", title="DUI F3 installed and active"]
. We are not done yet.

+
.The mod file contains INI tweaks we should review
image::DEFCON-02-Mod-Organizer-mod-contains-INI-tweaks.png["The mod file contains INI tweaks we should review", title="The mod file contains INI tweaks we should review"]
. Our custom mod has two INI files: `BetterFonts.ini` and `InterfaceColors.ini`. The first changes the fonts used in the user interface, replacing them by https://www.dafont.com/decotech.font[DecoTech] and https://www.dafont.com/sansation.font[Sansation], and the second changes the color of the user interface, using a blue ink. Check them both and click on *Close*.

. Now it's a good time to run the game and see for yourself how much has changed the user interface. This is a series of screenshots showing the overall look of the game before and after using DUI F3.

. I think you get the idea. Just two more quick remarks... On the main menu you will see a Vault Boy head which, if hovered-over with the mouse, shows the game version, the DUI F3 version and the FOSE version.

image::DEFCON-02-Fallout-3-DUI-F3-Vault-Boy-head.png["Context info about the game, DUI F3 and FOSE", title="Context info about the game, DUI F3 and FOSE"]
. While in game, you will see new HUD items in the uppermost right corner, which, in this case, are the in-game date and time.
+
.In-game date and time via DUI F3
image::DEFCON-02-Fallout-3-DUI-F3-new-HUD-items.png["In-game date and time via DUI F3", title="In-game date and time via DUI F3"]
. If you press kbd:[ESC] while in-game, the game context menu appears, and you will see a new option *DUI F3* at the bottom.
+
.DUI F3 in-game settings option
image::DEFCON-02-Fallout-3-DUI-F3-in-game-settings-option.png["DUI F3 in-game settings option", title="DUI F3 in-game settings option"]
