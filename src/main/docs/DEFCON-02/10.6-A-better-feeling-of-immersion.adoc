I tend to play games with minimal HUD interfaces, in order to have a better feeling of immersion. It will make things a little harder, maybe, but I am the kind of person who plays _The Witcher 3_ in death march difficulty just for the sake of it.

The little mod (again, little in size, that is) we are about to install takes care of the HUD elements, getting rid of them until you really need them.

In the same https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqCzCXEydwU[ video about user interface mods] (25:05) Gopher explains how this mod works (around https://youtu.be/aqCzCXEydwU?t=18m20s[18:20]). Ignore the previous part about installing the mod using NMM.
