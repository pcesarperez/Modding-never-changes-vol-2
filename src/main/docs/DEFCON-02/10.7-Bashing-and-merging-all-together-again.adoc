=== Bashing and merging all together (again)

Installing the merged and bashed patches is going to be a simple process from now on, as I will provide the patches in a bundled, ready-to-install fashion.

Remember: you have to have installed all the mods in this DEFCON chapter, in the right order, to be able to use the pre-packaged patches I provide. Otherwise, you can create your own <<Appendix 1: How to create your own merged patch, merged patches>> and <<Appendix 2: How to create your own bashed patch, bashed patches>>.

. Open MO and switch to the *Downloads* tab in the right pane.
. Download the pre-packaged patch link:patches/DEFCON-02-Merged-Patch-1.0.zip[DEFCON 02 Merged Patch] to a location of your choice.
. Download the pre-packaged patch link:patches/DEFCON-02-Bashed-Patch-1.0.zip[DEFCON 02 Bashed Patch] to a location of your choice.
. Click on the button sideload a mod from an archive.

. Select the file `DEFCON-01-Merged-Patch-1.0.zip` in the location where you downloaded it.
. The mod is installed automatically. Move it above the deactivated DEFCON 01 patches and activate it in the left pane.

. Repeat the process for the bashed patch, selecting the file `DEFCON-02-Bashed-Patch-1.0.zip` this time. Put the bashed patch between the merged patch and the deactivated DEFCON 01 patches.
