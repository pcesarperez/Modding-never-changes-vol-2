=== Chapter recap

Well, this has been a short chapter, compared to the previous one. You have to know that there are HUGE chapters ahead, I fear. I hope I have finished the guide before Vortex is out `¬¬`

We have made subtle but important changes in this chapter. The game keeps being essentially the same, but the user interface is much more polished and doesn't get in the way.

You can stop right here and have a plenty _Fallout 3_ experience with a patched game and a better user interface. However, we are going to install some pretty darn interesting mods in the next chapter which will take the user interface to the next level. Will you come along?
