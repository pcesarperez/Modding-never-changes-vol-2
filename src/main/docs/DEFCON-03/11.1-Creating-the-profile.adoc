=== Creating the profile

As usual, we are going to create the profile beforehand. Remember that each profile is created on top of the previous one, and we need to deactivate the customized merged and bashed patches because we are going to create new ones at the end of the DEFCON chapter.

. Click on the MO profiles button.
