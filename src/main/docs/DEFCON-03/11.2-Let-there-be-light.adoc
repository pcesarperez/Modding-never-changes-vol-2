Nights in the Capital Wasteland can be very dark and very frightening, so... What about having a flashlight to soothe your fear of the dark. Not that this will avoid your sorry ass to be torn apart by the radiation-infused things that swarm the area, but hey, at least you will see them coming. That's a relief. Sort of.

. We need to change the hotkey assigned to activate the flashlight (kbd:[b] by default). The default hotkey will collide with the key to change fire rate in http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/20012/[JIP Selective-Fire], which we will install later on. Launch the game and bring up your Pip-Boy with the kbd:[Tab] key. Navigate to the *Items* button, *Apparel* section and click on the *Flashlight Options* entry.

. In the following menu, select *Change hotkey* to assign a new hotkey to the flashlight.

. Although apparently nothing happens, the mod is waiting for you to hit the new key (not very user friendly, I'd say). We will assign the kbd:[l] key to activate the flashlight, so hit it. When you do that, a new dialog appears, pointing out that the key has just been changed. Click on *Ok* and put back your Pip-Boy by hitting kbd:[Tab].
+
.Flashlight hotkey has just been changed

. Now press the kbd:[l] key to switch the flashlight on and off.
+
.Flashlight off and on

. Don't forget we have just installed two lighting mods. SmoothLight is subtler, but it improves the stock flashlight our Pip-Boy has. Long-press the kbd:[Tab] key to switch this light on and off to see its effects.
