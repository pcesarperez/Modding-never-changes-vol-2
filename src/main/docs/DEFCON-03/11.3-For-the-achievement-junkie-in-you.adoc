If you have ever played _World of Warcraft_, you will know that there is a deep, ingrained part of your reptilian brain that generates a huge amount of endorphines every time you get an _Achievement unlocked_ message after fulfilling a series of tasks.

I know what I am talking about. Trust me.

Well, _there are_ achievements in _Fallout 3_, but they are not clearly visible after their first (and only) appearance. http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/11326/[This mod] (and http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/18678/[its fix]) lets you view all your achievements in the *Data*/*Notes* section of your Pip-Boy.

. Open MO and switch to the *Downloads* tab in the right pane.
. Download the file [NexusFile]*Personal Achievements Log v12* from http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/11326/[_Personal Achievements Log_] with the manager.
. Download the file [NexusFile]*SeraphTCs Personal Achievements Log FIX* from http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/18678/[_SeraphTCs Personal Achievements Log FIX_] with the manager.

. Back to the MO main window, move the mod in the left pane between _Personal Achievements Log_ and _SmoothLight - Pip-Boy Light Enhancer_ and activate it. This mod contains a replacement for `PAL - MERGED.esp`, so no new plugins are added to the *Plugins* tab in the right pane. The plugins is already in its right place, so there's no need to run LOOT.

. If you start a fresh game, that's it. You will have your personal achievements log right off the bat. However, if you are following this guide to the letter, you will probably have started just outside Vault 101 using the proper saved game. In that case, look for a small data cartridge placed next to the Vault exit door beams. Take it to activate _Personal Achievements Log_.
