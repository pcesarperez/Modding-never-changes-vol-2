Let's face it: the vanilla map in _Fallout 3_ seems to have been produced from Dora the Explorer's backpack. And you don't want to start asking directions in D.C., because super-mutants are not known for their kindness of heart with strangers.

We are going to use http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/16898/[_Better High Detail Map and Icons_] to have decent maps, along with http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/15918/[_No more dots_] to get rid of the white dotted line that tells you the shortest path between you and a suitable http://www.darwinawards.com/[Darwin Awards] death, because in mathematics the straight line may be the shortest path between two points, but in real life, and specially in the Capital Wasteland, it's a ticket to Hell.

. Open MO and switch to the *Downloads* tab in the right pane.
. Download the file [NexusFile]*Better High Detail Map and Icons* from https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/16898/[_Better High Detail Map and Icons_] with the manager.
. Download the file [NexusFile]*no more dots v01* from https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/15918/[_no more dots_] with the manager.

. Double click on [NexusFile]*Better High Detail Map and Icons*. In this case, no Quick Install window will be shown. The mod comes with a FOMOD installer which needs to be unpacked first.

. The mod comes with two Pip-Boy flavors in the chamber: Pip-Boy 2500 and Pip-Boy 3000 (the default one). The first screen belongs to the Pip-Boy 2500 version, so we are going to select *None* for the map and *None* for the brightness, clicking on *Next*. By the way, don't change anything in the dropdown menu on the top (Nyarlathotep knows why is it there).

. We are going full throttle in the Pip-Boy 3000 options window, choosing 8K map with roads and a 50% brightness correction. Click on *Next* afterwards.

. The next window contains the customization options for the mod. Select custom icons and blue markers. Click on *Install*.

. The FOMOD installer will deploy the files according to the selected options and the mod will sit on the bottom of the left pane. Move it just under _Faster Pipboy Faster_ and activate it.

. Now, let's get rid of the asinine dots in the map. Double click on [NexusFile]*no more dots v01*. Mod Organizer shows the inner structure without Quick Install window. The inner structure is a bit off, so right click on the `[Data]` folder and select *Set data directory*.

.No more dots inner structure correction

. The structure is now palatable, so click on *Ok*.

. As usual, move the mod in the left pane to the right position, below _Shiloh DS - Clean Pipboy Screen_ and activate it. There are no plugins installed, so there's no need to run LOOT.

Let's see the look of the new map, before and after the retexturing.

You may think that the change is not so good after all. The old map was schematic, yes, but at least it showed the roads, right?

Well, zoom-in and think again.
