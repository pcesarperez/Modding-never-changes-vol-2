== Metacrap

No guide would be complete without legal stuff and whatnot. I'll be brief. I promise.

*What?*::
A modding guide for _Fallout 3 Game of the Year Edition_ using https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1334/[Mod Organizer] (take into account that the final version is labeled "legacy version" in the https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6194[Mod Organizer 2 page]). This is version *{revnumber}* of the guide.

*Who?*::
Pablo César Pérez González, aka pcesarperez, aka adastra, reachable through mailto:modding.never.changes@gmail.com[modding.never.changes].

*When?*::
Sometime after the completion of volume 1 and before the beginning of volume 3, I guess.

*Where?*::
Where my cat allows me to be, of course.

*Why?*::
I am still wondering about it. I'll call you back when I get a clear answer.

Finally, you will find the source for this book in https://github.com/pcesarperez/Modding-never-changes-vol-2[its GitHub repo]. You can even https://github.com/pcesarperez/Modding-never-changes-vol-2/issues[create an issue] if you think there is something I should improve in the guide (and trust me, there is a shitload of room for improvement).
