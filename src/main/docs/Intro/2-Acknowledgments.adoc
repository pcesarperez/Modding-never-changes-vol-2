== Acknowledgments

In the modding scene, you cannot even think about writing a guide like this without standing on the shoulder of giants, unless you are a hardened pioneer, of course. Which I am not.

I have read and viewed a lot of resources before writing a single line of this guide. These are the authors of such resources:

* *https://www.youtube.com/user/GophersVids[Gopher]* is one of my favorite modders and youtubers out there. I have been watching his videos since my interest in modding bloomed. His is the https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7DlYarj-DcLS9LyjEqOJwFUQIIQewcK[Mod Organizer video series], albeit he uses _Skyrim_ to show the tool capabilities.
* *https://www.youtube.com/user/ar15nurse[Cal, from Dirty Weasel Media]* is one of my latest additions to my subscription list. He has created a fantastic https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWMvEg2LxwXbtc-mZT_H9pOwhIdOcMcn9[guide about Modding _Fallout 3_ with Mod Organizer] which has been very helpful.
* *https://www.youtube.com/user/MrXuul[Xuul]* is a youtuber with a lot of quality and up-to-date videos about modding. His is https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4turVkHE168Yyj8g9k_s9GCCvW0f_apX[a complete guide to mod _Fallout 3_ with Mod Organizer].
* *https://www.youtube.com/user/gamerpoets[Michael, from GamerPoets]* is a modder and youtuber that I have recently discovered through Gopher's series about Mod Organizer. He and his team have *A FUCKIN' LOT* of tutorials about modding, all of them very thorough and detailed. I have used several resources from GamerPoets, like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqFCLrYn30c[a guide about LOOT] and a https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F19Do8HAl4[guide about xEdit].
* *http://wiki.step-project.com/Main_Page[The people behind S.T.E.P. Project]* have the best guides out there about modding _Skyrim_, and in that context they have published http://wiki.step-project.com/Guide:Mod_Organizer[the official guide for Mod Organizer].
* Kelmych has written http://wiki.step-project.com/User:Kelmych/Fallout3[_Clear and Present Danger_], *THE GUIDE* about modding _Fallout 3_. This guide has been on my bedside table for weeks, and its detailed explanations are invaluable.
