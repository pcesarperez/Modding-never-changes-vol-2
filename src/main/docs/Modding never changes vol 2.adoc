You can even https://github.com/pcesarperez/Modding-never-changes-vol-2/issues[create an issue] if you think there is something I should improve in the guide (and trust me, there is a shitload of room for improvement).

== Acknowledgments

In the modding scene, you cannot even think about writing a guide like this without standing on the shoulder of giants, unless you are a hardened pioneer, of course. Which I am not.

I have read and viewed a lot of resources before writing a single line of this guide. These are the authors of such resources:

* *https://www.youtube.com/user/GophersVids[Gopher]* is one of my favourite modders and youtubers out there. I have been watching his videos since my interest in modding bloomed. His is the https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7DlYarj-DcLS9LyjEqOJwFUQIIQewcK[Mod Organizer video series], albeit he uses _Skyrim_ to show the tool capabilities.
* *https://www.youtube.com/user/ar15nurse[Cal, from Dirty Weasel Media]* is one of my late additions to my subscription list. He has created a fantastic https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWMvEg2LxwXbtc-mZT_H9pOwhIdOcMcn9[guide about Modding _Fallout 3_ with Mod Organizer] which has been very helpful.
* *https://www.youtube.com/user/MrXuul[Xuul]* is a youtuber with a lot of quality and up-to-date videos about modding. His is https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4turVkHE168Yyj8g9k_s9GCCvW0f_apX[a complete guide to mod _Fallout 3_ with Mod Organizer].
* *https://www.youtube.com/user/gamerpoets[Michael, from GamerPoets]* is a modder and youtuber that I have recently discovered through Gopher's series about Mod Organizer. He and his team has *A FUCKIN' LOT* of tutorials about modding, all of them very thorough and detailed. I have used several resources from GamerPoets, like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqFCLrYn30c[a guide about LOOT] and a https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F19Do8HAl4[guide about xEdit].
* *http://wiki.step-project.com/Main_Page[The people behind S.T.E.P. Project]* have the best guides out there about modding _Skyrim_, and in that context they have published http://wiki.step-project.com/Guide:Mod_Organizer[the official guide for Mod Organizer].
* Kelmych has written http://wiki.step-project.com/User:Kelmych/Fallout3[_Clear and Present Danger_], *THE GUIDE* about modding _Fallout 3_. This guide has been on my bedside table for weeks, and its detailed explanations are invaluable.

== Introduction

I have always had, as far as my memory is able to recall, a strong bias for post-apocalyptic games, books and films. The tale of strong individuals or drawn-together communities struggling to survive in a harsh and unforgivable environment has always caught me. The _S.T.A.L.K.E.R._ series, by GSC Game World, the _Metro_ novels, by Dmitry Glukhovsky, or the _Prism Pentad_ novels in the _Dark Sun_ universe, by Troy Denning, are examples that come easily to mind.

I admit I never played the original _Fallout 1_ and _Fallout 2_ games, although they are considered to show https://warisboring.com/why-fallout-is-the-best-nuclear-war-story-ever-told-5910918d28e4#.oroyrzbn0[the best depiction of the effects of a Nuclear War]. They went under my radar in my compulsive gaming-spree youth. But, oh my, when I first laid my eyes on _Fallout 3_, it was love at first sight. The game was released in 2008, and I have been playing it in and out since then, although I have never completed the main quest line. There are a lot of unfinished games in my backpack, I guess.

My first playthrough was with the Vanilla version of the game, and it was the longer one. And when I discovered mods, it taught me a valuable lesson: you should always play the unmodded version of the game, to get a sense of that could be improved or fixed.

I love post-apocalyptic games, and I love tinkering with things, so the recipe _Fallout 3_ + mods is a perfect win for me.

Slushes apart, _Fallout 3_ is an old game, and what it is more important, it is a Bethesda Softworks' game, and it means a lot of bugs out-of-the-box. The mods we are going to install address these bugs to fix the game, but they also greatly improve the game in every aspect, from playability to graphics, going through sounds and music.

So that is what we want to achieve with this guide: having a step-by-step process to get a fully modded _Fallout 3_ game, with no flaws (almost), with a serious performance boost and with visuals, audio and game mechanics enhanced.

If you are in a rush of excitement and you cannot wait to start modding the hell out of _Fallout 3_, jump ahead to chapter <<DEFCON 00 (Vanilla)>>. Otherwise, read the rest of the introductory chapters to know <<Why Mod Organizer?, why are we choosing Mod Organizer as our modding tool>>, <<Functional vs. Technical, how is the guide organized and why>>, <<The tools we need, which are the tools we need to get the job done>>, and <<Conventions used in this guide, which are the conventions used in writing this guide>>.

== Why Mod Organizer?

When I started writing https://pcesarperez.github.io/modding-never-changes/[the first volume of this guide] I didn't know of the existence of Mod Organizer. I was halfway through the writing when I seriously considered trashing out what I had done after watching https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7DlYarj-DcLS9LyjEqOJwFUQIIQewcK[Gopher's series about Mod Organizer], in one of my random video-hunting sessions.

I decided not to, and I think I did right. Writing the guide using Nexus Mod Manager taught me how to mod a game, how important is the install order, what is the load order, and so on.

To illustrate the main advantage of Mod Organizer (MO) over Nexus Mod Manager (NMM), let's imagine this scenario: you are halfway through your mod stack setup, and you find a new, incredible mod you cannot live without (trust me, it happens). You have two choices: either risking your setup by just adding the mod, if it is not overly aggressive (and by "not overly aggressive" I mean "does not overwrite a lot of previously installed assets"), or restarting your modding process, installing the mod in its proper place. The later will usually be the sensible choice, although tedious and frustrating.

That's what should happen with NMM, but not with MO. Have you found an oh-my-gosh-I-need-this mod? Just throw it into the right profile and rearrange your mod stack, carefully controlling the assets that will be overwritten. There are other advantages, too, pointed out in the http://wiki.step-project.com/Guide:Mod_Organizer[official guide]:

* Your data folder will be kept clean. No more cluttered data folders, because MO uses a virtual folder to install the mods.
* Merging different files into a single mod is dead easy. You don't have to have a lot of different entries in your mod stack for each mod you install.
* You have integrated tools to fiddle with the inner structure of the mods, so you will be able to fix any weirdness the mod comes with before installing it.
* Knowing which files are overwritten and by which mod in your setup is a no-brainer.
* Profiles! Do you need a profile for a heavy-gunner with specific mods? Done! Do you need a profile for a hard nerd whose favourite problem solving method is talking her way out of it? Done! Each profile has its individual mod configuration, which is perfect for the progressive, functional approach we are going to use throughout this guide.

There are several downsides too, of course, although none of them is a real deal breaker:

* MO is a bit more difficult than NMM. It's not rocket science, but you have to know what you are doing to have a correct mod stack. Installing a mod is not as simple as throwing it into your mod stack. You have to know which files from other mods it should overwrite and which of its files should be overwritten.
* Sometimes, mods with scripted installers (aka FOMOD/BAIN installers) do have a weird behavior under MO, even not working at all. There are ways around these issues, but still.
* MO doesn't work with 64 bits games, so we are stuck with NMM for games like _Fallout 4_ and _The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim Special Edition_.

Once you start using MO, there's no turning back to NMM. Ever. Even though both of them http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/news/12905/?[are endangered species now]. The next breed of NMM will supposedly have all the features of MO, but until then, MO is our winning horse.
