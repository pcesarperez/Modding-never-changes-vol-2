== Acknowledgments

In the modding scene, you cannot even think about writing a guide like this without standing on the shoulder of giants, unless you are a hardened pioneer, of course. Which I am not.

I have read and viewed a lot of resources before writing a single line of this guide. These are the authors of such resources:

* *https://www.youtube.com/user/GophersVids[Gopher]* is one of my favourite modders and youtubers out there. I have been watching his videos since my interest in modding bloomed. His is the https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7DlYarj-DcLS9LyjEqOJwFUQIIQewcK[Mod Organizer video series], albeit he uses _Skyrim_ to show the tool capabilities.
* *https://www.youtube.com/user/ar15nurse[Cal, from Dirty Weasel Media]* is one of my latest additions to my subscription list. He has created a fantastic https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWMvEg2LxwXbtc-mZT_H9pOwhIdOcMcn9[guide about Modding _Fallout 3_ with Mod Organizer] which has been very helpful.
* *https://www.youtube.com/user/MrXuul[Xuul]* is a youtuber with a lot of quality and up-to-date videos about modding. His is https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4turVkHE168Yyj8g9k_s9GCCvW0f_apX[a complete guide to mod _Fallout 3_ with Mod Organizer].
* *https://www.youtube.com/user/gamerpoets[Michael, from GamerPoets]* is a modder and youtuber that I have recently discovered through Gopher's series about Mod Organizer. He and his team has *A FUCKIN' LOT* of tutorials about modding, all of them very thorough and detailed. I have used several resources from GamerPoets, like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqFCLrYn30c[a guide about LOOT] and a https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F19Do8HAl4[guide about xEdit].
* *http://wiki.step-project.com/Main_Page[The people behind S.T.E.P. Project]* have the best guides out there about modding _Skyrim_, and in that context they have published http://wiki.step-project.com/Guide:Mod_Organizer[the official guide for Mod Organizer].
* Kelmych has written http://wiki.step-project.com/User:Kelmych/Fallout3[_Clear and Present Danger_], *THE GUIDE* about modding _Fallout 3_. This guide has been on my bedside table for weeks, and its detailed explanations are invaluable.




== Introduction

I have always had, as far as my memory is able to recall, a strong bias for post-apocalyptic games, books and films. The tale of strong individuals or drawn-together communities struggling to survive in a harsh and unforgivable environment has always caught me. The _S.T.A.L.K.E.R._ series, by GSC Game World, the _Metro_ novels, by Dmitry Glukhovsky, or the _Prism Pentad_ novels in the _Dark Sun_ universe, by Troy Denning, are examples that come easily to mind.

I admit I never played the original _Fallout 1_ and _Fallout 2_ games, although they are considered to show https://warisboring.com/why-fallout-is-the-best-nuclear-war-story-ever-told-5910918d28e4#.oroyrzbn0[the best depiction of the effects of a Nuclear War]. They went under my radar in my compulsive gaming-spree youth. But, oh my, when I first laid my eyes on _Fallout 3_, it was love at first sight. The game was released in 2008, and I have been playing it in and out since then, although I have never completed the main quest line. There are a lot of unfinished games in my backpack, I guess.

My first playthrough was with the Vanilla version of the game, and it was the longer one. And when I discovered mods, it taught me a valuable lesson: you should always play the unmodded version of the game, to get a sense of that could be improved or fixed.

I love post-apocalyptic games, and I love tinkering with things, so the recipe _Fallout 3_ + mods is a perfect win for me.

Slushes apart, _Fallout 3_ is an old game, and what it is more important, it is a Bethesda Softworks' game, and it means a lot of bugs out-of-the-box. The mods we are going to install address these bugs to fix the game, but they also greatly improve the game in every aspect, from playability to graphics, going through sounds and music.

So that is what we want to achieve with this guide: having a step-by-step process to get a fully modded _Fallout 3_ game, with no flaws (almost), with a serious performance boost and with visuals, audio and game mechanics enhanced.

If you are in a rush of excitement and you cannot wait to start modding the hell out of _Fallout 3_, jump ahead to chapter <<DEFCON 00 (Vanilla)>>. Otherwise, read the rest of the introductory chapters to know <<Why Mod Organizer?, why are we choosing Mod Organizer as our modding tool>>, <<Functional vs. Technical, how is the guide organized and why>>, <<The tools we need, which are the tools we need to get the job done>>, and <<Conventions used in this guide, which are the conventions used in writing this guide>>.




== Why Mod Organizer?

When I started writing https://pcesarperez.github.io/modding-never-changes/[the first volume of this guide] I didn't know of the existence of Mod Organizer. I was halfway through the writing when I seriously considered trashing out what I had done after watching https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7DlYarj-DcLS9LyjEqOJwFUQIIQewcK[Gopher's series about Mod Organizer], in one of my random video-hunting sessions.

I decided not to, and I think I did right. Writing the guide using Nexus Mod Manager taught me how to mod a game, how important is the install order, what is the load order, and so on.

To illustrate the main advantage of Mod Organizer (MO) over Nexus Mod Manager (NMM), let's imagine this scenario: you are halfway through your mod stack setup, and you find a new, incredible mod you cannot live without (trust me, it happens). You have two choices: either risking your setup by just adding the mod, if it is not overly aggressive (and by "not overly aggressive" I mean "does not overwrite a lot of previously installed assets"), or restarting your modding process, installing the mod in its proper place. The later will usually be the sensible choice, although tedious and frustrating.

That's what should happen with NMM, but not with MO. Have you found an oh-my-gosh-I-need-this mod? Just throw it into the right profile and rearrange your mod stack, carefully controlling the assets that will be overwritten. There are other advantages, too, pointed out in the http://wiki.step-project.com/Guide:Mod_Organizer[official guide]:

* Your data folder will be kept clean. No more cluttered data folders, because MO uses a virtual folder to install the mods.
* Merging different files into a single mod is dead easy. You don't have to have a lot of different entries in your mod stack for each mod you install.
* You have integrated tools to fiddle with the inner structure of the mods, so you will be able to fix any weirdness the mod comes with before installing it.
* Knowing which files are overwritten and by which mod in your setup is a no-brainer.
* Profiles! Do you need a profile for a heavy-gunner with specific mods? Done! Do you need a profile for a hard nerd whose favourite problem solving method is talking her way out of it? Done! Each profile has its individual mod configuration, which is perfect for the progressive, functional approach we are going to use throughout this guide.

There are several downsides too, of course, although none of them is a real deal breaker:

* MO is a bit more difficult than NMM. It's not rocket science, but you have to know what you are doing to have a correct mod stack. Installing a mod is not as simple as throwing it into your mod stack. You have to know which files from other mods it should overwrite and which of its files should be overwritten.
* Sometimes, mods with scripted installers (aka FOMOD/BAIN installers) do have a weird behavior under MO, even not working at all. There are ways around these issues, but still.
* MO doesn't work with 64 bits games, so we are stuck with NMM for games like _Fallout 4_ and _The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim Special Edition_.

Once you start using MO, there's no turning back to NMM. Ever. Even though both of them http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/news/12905/?[are endangered species now]. The next breed of NMM will supposedly have all the features of MO, but until then, MO is our winning horse.




== Functional vs. Technical

There are a lot of _Fallout 3_ modding guides out there. This is just another one, but I'd like to think that my approach to the matter is slightly different, because it's a functional one.

What the hell do I mean by "functional"? Well, at the end of each main chapter (called *DEFCON*), you will have a version of the game with certain features: bugfixes, new sounds, new animations, etc. Chapters are cumulative, this is, each chapter is built on top of the previous one. Thus, this guide is intended to be followed from cover to cover, although you can skip any chapter you wish, taking into account that, from that point on, you are in _Terra Incognita_, all by yourself.

This approach has its advantages and disadvantages. I think it's more understandable for the reader, albeit more complex to perform under the hood.

It would be good for you to understand the concept of _load order_ before going on. Gopher has two videos explaining https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzsBKYUrcbE[what is load order] (20:00) and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzoyWugzZAw[how to use LOOT to manage our load order] (13:59). Both are worth checking out.

However, there is something you need to understand besides load order, and it is what I call _stacking order_, or in MO jargon, _priority order_. Each mod could have one of these items, or both:

* One or more data files, which may be `.esm` (master) or `.esp` (ancillary) files.
* A number of assets, like textures, sounds, meshes, menu files, etc.

Data files are bound by load order, whereas assets are bound by stacking order. Gopher has a very good video explaining everything about https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVSy_5M3NTc[conflicts and priorities] in MO, and the Official Guide has http://wiki.step-project.com/Guide:Mod_Organizer#Priorities[an entire chapter devoted to priorities].

To keep this short and straight, we are going to carefully place each mod in its proper place, taking into account the priorities. This is, if you install mod "A" with a certain asset "foo", and later you install mod "B" with an equally named asset "foo" down in the priority list (with a higher priority), "B" version of "foo" will overwrite "A" version of "foo", although you can easily rearrange the stacking order if you find out it's not correct. But that's something I have to worry about, not you, at least regarding this guide.




== The tools we need

These are the tools we are going to use throughout this guide. Don't worry about installing them yet; their setup will be addressed in the proper chapters. However, you can save precious time by downloading them right now.

Mod Organizer::
http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1334/[Mod Organizer] is an advanced modding tool. It is not as wide-scoped as Nexus Mod Manager, because it only supports _Fallout 3_, _Fallout New Vegas_, _The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion_ and _The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim_ (not the _Special Edition_, though). However, is way more powerful than NMM. Once you start modding with it, you wonder where the fuck was this tool your whole life.

xEdit::
http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/2737/[xEdit] comprises, in fact, several tools, each oriented to a specific game. Each version takes its name from the game it is aimed to, so the latest version is called FO4Edit, because it has been developed for _Fallout 4_. Nevertheless, each version works with any game in the _Fallout_ or _The Elder Scrolls_ series, from _Fallout 3_ and _Oblivion_ on. This tool allows us to fiddle with data files (`.esm` or `.esp`), cleaning them and modifying them if there is some kind of error. It also allows to clean data files, which have often duplicated or undeleted entries. Finally, it will help us to create a http://wiki.step-project.com/Guide:Merging_Plugins#xEdit_Merge_Patch[_Merged Patch_] to ensure a better game stability. More on that later on.

LOOT::
https://loot.github.io/[LOOT] is the best tool out there to keep your load order in check. It relies on an artifact called _the masterlist_, which is a list of mod's metadata to calculate the right load order for your mod stack.

Wrye Flash::
http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/11336/[Wrye Flash] is a modding tool akin to Mod Organizer it is scope, but very different for what we are going to use it. It will help us to create a http://wiki.step-project.com/Bashed_Patch[_Bashed Patch_] to further improve our game stability.

Don't worry if the ultimate purpose of each tool seems a bit vague. All of this will be thoroughly explained in time.




== Conventions used in this guide

The following conventions are used within this guide.

Game titles::
Game titles are shown in italicized text, like _Fallout 3_ or _The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim_.

Mod names::
Any mod used in this guide is shown using an italicized link to the mod's original page. For example, http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1121454-wipzbeta-darnified-ui-f3/[_DarNified UI F3_] or http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/2761/[_FWE - FO3 Wanderers Edition_]. The name is shown as is, with the title given by its author, no matter how many grammar or orthographic rules have been murdered in the process.

Filenames and paths::
Any filename or path, complete or partial, is shown using monospaced text, like `[%USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Games\Fallout3]`, `Fallout.ini` or `.esp`.

Files within Nexus::
A mod hosted in Nexus will usually have several files (for example, the http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/2761/?tab=2&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Ffallout3%2Fajax%2Fmodfiles%2F%3Fid%3D2761&pUp=1[multiple files which belong to FWE]). Sometimes is difficult to know exactly which files have to be downloaded, thus they are shown using a green, bold text, mimicking Nexus own style, like [NexusFile]*FWE 6-03a HOTFIX PATCH* or [NexusFile]*MMM-6_2-update*.

Info blocks::
Info blocks are used at the beginning of each chapter to show the list of mods which are going to be installed. For example:

[NOTE]

	DEFCON 00 (Vanilla) chapter.
////

== DEFCON 00 (Vanilla)

In this chapter we are going to build the foundation for the modding process, installing the game and the necessary tools. Thus, no real modding will be done here.

At the end of the chapter we will be ready to start with the modding, with all the tools in place. We will have our first profile, although it will contain the Vanilla version of the game.




=== Installing the game

I am assuming we are using the Steam edition of _Fallout 3 Game of the Year Edition_, with all 5 DLCs. This is what you have to do first and foremost.

. Install Steam outside UAC-controlled space. In other words, *DO NOT* install Steam in the default location, under `[C:\Program Files]`. Install it instead in `[C:\Games]` or any other location of your choice. If you have Steam already installed in UAC-controlled space, check this guide about https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7418-YUBN-8129[moving a Steam installation and games]. We will refer to the final Steam location as `[%STEAM_HOME%]`.
. Install _Fallout 3 Game of the Year Edition_ through Steam. The game will be located at `[%STEAM_HOME%\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty]`, which we will refer to as `[%FO3_HOME%]` from now on.
. You *MUST* run the game at least once to create the configuration files the game needs, so double-click on the launcher icon you should have in your desktop.
+
._Fallout 3_ launcher icon
image::DEFCON-00-Fallout-3-launcher-icon.png[_Fallout 3_ launcher icon]
. The launcher dutifully informs you that video hardware is about to be detected, thus setting up the configuration for you.
+
.Video hardware detection message
image::DEFCON-00-Video-hardware-detection-message.png[Video hardware detection message]
. After a brief moment, the launcher shows a message with the quality settings it has detected for your box (my rig is a crap, but the game is rather old, so...).
+
.Video hardware settings detected
image::DEFCON-00-Video-hardware-settings-detected.png[Video hardware settings detected]
. And here we go! This is the launcher in all its greenish glory.
+
._Fallout 3_ launcher
image::DEFCON-00-Fallout-3-launcher.png[_Fallout 3_ launcher]
. Click on *Options* to adjust the video resolution. Don't bother changing anything else right now.
+
._Fallout 3_ settings
image::DEFCON-00-Video-resolution-adjustment.png[_Fallout 3_ settings]
. Click on *Play* in the launcher to launch the game with the preferred settings. The game will show the main menu.
+
._Fallout 3_ main menu
image::DEFCON-00-Fallout-3-main-menu.png[_Fallout 3_ main menu]
+
[WARNING]
====
You may run into an error like this one when trying to run the game for the first time:

.Error about absent Games for Windows Live
image::DEFCON-00-Games-for-Windows-Live-absent.png[Error about absent Games for Windows Live]

To fix this, download and install the http://www.xbox.com/en-US/Live/PC/DownloadClient[Games for Windows Marketplace Client] and try again.
====
. You can either click on *Play* or *Quit* in the main menu screen. If you are running the game under Windows 7 or Windows 8, odds are you won't be able to go beyond this screen. In Windows 10 you may run the game, although an annoying warning appears every time you run the launcher.
+
.Windows 10 warning about running _Fallout 3_
image::DEFCON-00-Windows-compatibility-warning.png[Windows 10 warning about running _Fallout 3_]
. However, this is all we need, for now. Just click on *Quit* and check this files and folders under `[%USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Games\Fallout3]` (`[%USERPROFILE%\My Documents\My Games\Fallout3]`, if you are using Windows 7):
* `[Saves]`
* `FALLOUT3.INI`
* `FalloutPrefs.ini`
* `RendererInfo.txt`
