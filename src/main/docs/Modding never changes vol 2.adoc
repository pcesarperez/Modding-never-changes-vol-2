== Acknowledgments

In the modding scene, you cannot even think about writing a guide like this without standing on the shoulder of giants, unless you are a hardened pioneer, of course. Which I am not.

I have read and viewed a lot of resources before writing a single line of this guide. These are the authors of such resources:

* *https://www.youtube.com/user/GophersVids[Gopher]* is one of my favorite modders and youtubers out there. I have been watching his videos since my interest in modding bloomed. His is the https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7DlYarj-DcLS9LyjEqOJwFUQIIQewcK[Mod Organizer video series], albeit he uses _Skyrim_ to show the tool capabilities.
* *https://www.youtube.com/user/ar15nurse[Cal, from Dirty Weasel Media]* is one of my latest additions to my subscription list. He has created a fantastic https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWMvEg2LxwXbtc-mZT_H9pOwhIdOcMcn9[guide about Modding _Fallout 3_ with Mod Organizer] which has been very helpful.
* *https://www.youtube.com/user/MrXuul[Xuul]* is a youtuber with a lot of quality and up-to-date videos about modding. His is https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4turVkHE168Yyj8g9k_s9GCCvW0f_apX[a complete guide to mod _Fallout 3_ with Mod Organizer].
* *https://www.youtube.com/user/gamerpoets[Michael, from GamerPoets]* is a modder and youtuber that I have recently discovered through Gopher's series about Mod Organizer. He and his team has *A FUCKIN' LOT* of tutorials about modding, all of them very thorough and detailed. I have used several resources from GamerPoets, like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqFCLrYn30c[a guide about LOOT] and a https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F19Do8HAl4[guide about xEdit].
* *http://wiki.step-project.com/Main_Page[The people behind S.T.E.P. Project]* have the best guides out there about modding _Skyrim_, and in that context they have published http://wiki.step-project.com/Guide:Mod_Organizer[the official guide for Mod Organizer].
* Kelmych has written http://wiki.step-project.com/User:Kelmych/Fallout3[_Clear and Present Danger_], *THE GUIDE* about modding _Fallout 3_. This guide has been on my bedside table for weeks, and its detailed explanations are invaluable.




== Introduction

I have always had, as far as my memory is able to recall, a strong bias for post-apocalyptic games, books and films. The tale of strong individuals or drawn-together communities struggling to survive in a harsh and unforgivable environment has always caught me. The _S.T.A.L.K.E.R._ series, by GSC Game World, the _Metro_ novels, by Dmitry Glukhovsky, or the _Prism Pentad_ novels in the _Dark Sun_ universe, by Troy Denning, are examples that come easily to mind.

I admit I never played the original _Fallout 1_ and _Fallout 2_ games, although they are considered to show https://warisboring.com/why-fallout-is-the-best-nuclear-war-story-ever-told-5910918d28e4#.oroyrzbn0[the best depiction of the effects of a Nuclear War]. They went under my radar in my compulsive gaming-spree youth. But, oh my, when I first laid my eyes on _Fallout 3_, it was love at first sight. The game was released in 2008, and I have been playing it in and out since then, although I have never completed the main quest line. There are a lot of unfinished games in my backpack, I guess.

My first playthrough was with the Vanilla version of the game, and it was the longer one. And when I discovered mods, it taught me a valuable lesson: you should always play the unmodded version of the game, to get a sense of that could be improved or fixed.

I love post-apocalyptic games, and I love tinkering with things, so the recipe _Fallout 3_ + mods is a perfect win for me.

Slushes apart, _Fallout 3_ is an old game, and what it is more important, it is a Bethesda Softworks' game, and it means a lot of bugs out-of-the-box. The mods we are going to install address these bugs to fix the game, but they also greatly improve the game in every aspect, from playability to graphics, going through sounds and music.

So that is what we want to achieve with this guide: having a step-by-step process to get a fully modded _Fallout 3_ game, with no flaws (almost), with a serious performance boost and with visuals, audio and game mechanics enhanced, and all of this having a clean, pristine game data folder.

If you are in a rush of excitement and you cannot wait to start modding the hell out of _Fallout 3_, jump ahead to chapter <<DEFCON 00 (Vanilla)>>. Otherwise, read the rest of the introductory chapters to know <<Why Mod Organizer?, why are we choosing Mod Organizer as our modding tool>>, <<Functional vs. Technical, how is the guide organized and why>>, <<The tools we need, which are the tools we need to get the job done>>, and <<Conventions used in this guide, which are the conventions used in writing this guide>>.




== Why Mod Organizer?

When I started writing https://pcesarperez.github.io/modding-never-changes/[the first volume of this guide] I didn't know of the existence of Mod Organizer. I was halfway through the writing when I seriously considered trashing out what I had done after watching https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7DlYarj-DcLS9LyjEqOJwFUQIIQewcK[Gopher's series about Mod Organizer], in one of my random video-hunting sessions.

I decided not to, and I think I did right. Writing the guide using Nexus Mod Manager taught me how to mod a game, how important is the install order, what is the load order, and so on.

To illustrate the main advantage of Mod Organizer (MO) over Nexus Mod Manager (NMM), let's imagine this scenario: you are halfway through your mod stack setup, and you find a new, incredible mod you cannot live without (trust me, it happens). You have two choices: either risking your setup by just adding the mod, if it is not overly aggressive (and by "not overly aggressive" I mean "does not overwrite a lot of previously installed assets"), or restarting your modding process, installing the mod in its proper place. The later will usually be the sensible choice, although tedious and frustrating.

That's what should happen with NMM, but not with MO. Have you found an oh-my-gosh-I-need-this mod? Just throw it into the right profile and rearrange your mod stack, carefully controlling the assets that will be overwritten. There are other advantages, too, pointed out in the http://wiki.step-project.com/Guide:Mod_Organizer[official guide]:

* Your data folder will be kept clean. No more cluttered data folders, because MO uses a virtual folder to install the mods.
* Merging different files into a single mod is dead easy. You don't have to have a lot of different entries in your mod stack for each mod you install.
* You have integrated tools to fiddle with the inner structure of the mods, so you will be able to fix any weirdness the mod comes with before installing it.
* Knowing which files are overwritten and by which mod in your setup is a no-brainer.
* Profiles! Do you need a profile for a heavy-gunner with specific mods? Done! Do you need a profile for a hard nerd whose favorite problem solving method is talking her way out of it? Done! Each profile has its individual mod configuration, which is perfect for the progressive, functional approach we are going to use throughout this guide.

There are several downsides too, of course, although none of them is a real deal breaker:

* MO is a bit more difficult than NMM. It's not rocket science, but you have to know what you are doing to have a correct mod stack. Installing a mod is not as simple as throwing it into your mod stack. You have to know which files from other mods it should overwrite and which of its files should be overwritten.
* Sometimes, mods with scripted installers (aka FOMOD/BAIN installers) do have a weird behavior under MO, even not working at all. There are ways around these issues, but still.
* MO doesn't work with 64 bits games, so we are stuck with NMM for games like _Fallout 4_ and _The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim Special Edition_.

Once you start using MO, there's no turning back to NMM. Ever. Even though both of them http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/news/12905/?[are endangered species now]. The next breed of NMM (http://www.nexusmods.com/games/news/13257/?[Vortex], that is) will supposedly have all the features of MO, but until then, MO is our winning horse.




== Functional vs. Technical

There are a lot of _Fallout 3_ modding guides out there. This is just another one, but I'd like to think that my approach to the matter is slightly different, because it's a functional one.

What the hell do I mean by "functional"? Well, at the end of each main chapter (called *DEFCON*), you will have a version of the game with certain features: bugfixes, new sounds, new animations, etc. Chapters are cumulative, this is, each chapter is built on top of the previous one. Thus, this guide is intended to be followed from cover to cover, although you can skip any chapter you wish, taking into account that, from that point on, you are in _Terra Incognita_, all by yourself.

This approach has its advantages and disadvantages. I think it's more understandable for the reader, albeit more complex to perform under the hood.

It would be good for you to understand the concept of _load order_ before going on. Gopher has two videos explaining https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzsBKYUrcbE[what is load order] (20:00) and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzoyWugzZAw[how to use LOOT to manage our load order] (13:59). Both are worth checking out.

However, there is something you need to understand besides load order, and it is what I call _stacking order_, or in MO jargon, _priority order_. Each mod could have one of these items, or both:

* One or more data files, which may be `.esm` (master) or `.esp` (ancillary) files.
* A number of assets, like textures, sounds, meshes, menu files, etc.

Data files are bound by load order, whereas assets are bound by stacking order. Gopher has a very good video explaining everything about https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVSy_5M3NTc[conflicts and priorities] in MO, and the Official Guide has http://wiki.step-project.com/Guide:Mod_Organizer#Priorities[an entire chapter devoted to priorities].

To keep this short and straight, we are going to carefully place each mod in its proper place, taking into account the priorities. This is, if you install mod "A" with a certain asset "foo", and later you install mod "B" with an equally named asset "foo" down in the priority list (with a higher priority), "B" version of "foo" will overwrite "A" version of "foo", although you can easily rearrange the stacking order if you find out it's not correct. But that's something I have to worry about, not you, at least regarding this guide.




== The tools we need

These are the tools we are going to use throughout this guide. Don't worry about installing them yet; their setup will be addressed in the proper chapters. However, you can save precious time by downloading them right now.

Mod Organizer::
http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1334/[Mod Organizer] is an advanced modding tool. It is not as wide-scoped as Nexus Mod Manager, because it only supports _Fallout 3_, _Fallout New Vegas_, _The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion_ and _The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim_ (not the _Special Edition_, though). However, is way more powerful than NMM. Once you start modding with it, you wonder where the fuck was this tool your whole life.

xEdit::
http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/2737/[xEdit] comprises, in fact, several tools, each oriented to a specific game. Each version takes its name from the game it is aimed to, so the latest version is called FO4Edit, because it has been developed for _Fallout 4_. Nevertheless, each version works with any game in the _Fallout_ or _The Elder Scrolls_ series, from _Fallout 3_ and _Oblivion_ on. This tool allows us to fiddle with data files (`.esm` or `.esp`), cleaning them and modifying them if there is some kind of error. It also allows to clean data files, which have often duplicated or undeleted entries. Finally, it will help us to create a http://wiki.step-project.com/Guide:Merging_Plugins#xEdit_Merge_Patch[_Merged Patch_] to ensure a better game stability. More on that later on.

LOOT::
https://loot.github.io/[LOOT] is the best tool out there to keep your load order in check. It relies on an artifact called _the masterlist_, which is a list of mod's metadata to calculate the right load order for your mod stack.

Wrye Flash::
http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/11336/[Wrye Flash] is a modding tool akin to Mod Organizer it is scope, but very different for what we are going to use it. It will help us to create a http://wiki.step-project.com/Bashed_Patch[_Bashed Patch_] to further improve our game stability.

Don't worry if the ultimate purpose of each tool seems a bit vague. All of this will be thoroughly explained in time.




== Conventions used in this guide

The following conventions are used within this guide.

Game titles::
Game titles are shown in italicized text, like _Fallout 3_ or _The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim_.

Mod names::
Any mod used in this guide is shown using an italicized link to the mod's original page. For example, http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1121454-wipzbeta-darnified-ui-f3/[_DarNified UI F3_] or http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/2761/[_FWE - FO3 Wanderers Edition_]. The name is shown as is, with the title given by its author, no matter how many grammar or orthographic rules have been murdered in the process.

Filenames and paths::
Any filename or path, complete or partial, is shown using monospaced text, like `[$USERPROFILE\Documents\My Games\Fallout3]`, `Fallout.ini` or `.esp`.

Files within Nexus::
A mod hosted in Nexus will usually have several files (for example, the http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/2761/?tab=2&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Ffallout3%2Fajax%2Fmodfiles%2F%3Fid%3D2761&pUp=1[multiple files which belong to FWE]). Sometimes is difficult to know exactly which files have to be downloaded, thus they are shown using a green, bold text, mimicking Nexus own style, like [NexusFile]*FWE 6-03a HOTFIX PATCH* or [NexusFile]*MMM-6_2-update*.

Info blocks::
Info blocks are used at the beginning of each chapter to show the list of mods which are going to be installed. For example:

[NOTE]
====
Mods used in this chapter:

* http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/3388/[_Weapon Mod Kits_]
* http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/8340/[_EVE - Energy Visuals Enhanced_]
* http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/6938/[_RH_IronSights - FOSE_]
* http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/16787/[_Paradox Ignition presents The Mergers_]
====

Tip blocks::
Tip blocks are used to give hints of links to further resources which expand the knowledge about specific topics. For example:

[TIP]
====
There is a complete https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWMvEg2LxwXbtc-mZT_H9pOwhIdOcMcn9[playlist about modding _Fallout 3_ with Mod Organizer], by Dirty Weasel Media.
====

Important blocks::
Important blocks are used at the end of each chapter which involves installing mods to provide links to the expected stacking and load orders, so you can check if your setup is not sidetracking. For example:

[IMPORTANT]
====
Your setup should comply with the following link:order_lists/DEFCON-01-1-stacking-order-after-Unofficial-Patch.txt[stacking order] and link:order_lists/DEFCON-01-1-load-order-after-Unofficial-Patch.txt[load order].

////
	DEFCON 00 (Vanilla) chapter.
////

== DEFCON 00 (Vanilla)

In this chapter we are going to build the foundation for the modding process, installing the game and the necessary tools. Thus, no real modding will be done here.

At the end of the chapter we will be ready to start with the modding, with all the tools in place. We will have our first profile, although it will contain the Vanilla version of the game.




=== Installing the game

I am assuming we are using the Steam edition of _Fallout 3 Game of the Year Edition_, with all 5 DLCs. This is what you have to do first and foremost.

. Install Steam outside UAC-controlled space. In other words, *DO NOT* install Steam in the default location, under `[C:\Program Files]`. Install it instead in `[C:\Games]` or any other location of your choice. If you have Steam already installed in UAC-controlled space, check this guide about https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7418-YUBN-8129[moving a Steam installation and games]. We will refer to the final Steam location as `[$STEAM_HOME]`.
. Install _Fallout 3 Game of the Year Edition_ through Steam. The game will be located at `[$STEAM_HOME\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty]`, which we will refer to as `[$FO3_HOME]` from now on.
. You *MUST* run the game at least once to create the configuration files the game needs, so double-click on the launcher icon you should have in your desktop.
+
._Fallout 3_ launcher icon
image::DEFCON-00-Fallout-3-launcher-icon.png[Fallout 3 launcher icon, title="Fallout 3 launcher icon"]
. The launcher dutifully informs you that video hardware is about to be detected, thus setting up the configuration for you.
+
.Video hardware detection message
image::DEFCON-00-Video-hardware-detection-message.png[Video hardware detection message, title="Video hardware detection message"]
. After a brief moment, the launcher shows a message with the quality settings it has detected for your box (my rig is a crap, but the game is rather old, so...).
+
.Video hardware settings detected
image::DEFCON-00-Video-hardware-settings-detected.png[Video hardware settings detected, title="Video hardware settings detected"]
. And here we go! This is the launcher in all its greenish glory.
+
._Fallout 3_ launcher
image::DEFCON-00-Fallout-3-launcher.png[Fallout 3 launcher, title="Fallout 3 launcher"]
. Click on *Options* to adjust the video resolution. Don't bother changing anything else right now.
+
._Fallout 3_ settings
image::DEFCON-00-Video-resolution-adjustment.png[Fallout 3 settings, title="Fallout 3 settings"]
. Click on *Play* in the launcher to launch the game with the preferred settings.
+
._Fallout 3_ launcher, ready for action
image::DEFCON-00-Fallout-3-launcher-ready.png[Fallout 3 launcher, ready for action, title="Fallout 3 launcher, ready for action"]
. You will probably run into an error like this one when trying to run the game for the first time, at least under Windows 10 Creators Update. To fix this, click on *Learn more* to open a browser window and download the Games for Windows Live client from Microsoft.
+
.Error about absent Games for Windows Live
image::DEFCON-00-Compatibility-Assistant.png[Error about absent Games for Windows Live, title="Error about absent Games for Windows Live"]
. Install the client running the `gfwlivesetup.exe` file you just downloaded. The installation will be brief.
+
.Games for Windows Live installation
image::DEFCON-00-Games-for-Windows-Live-installation.png[Games for Windows Live installation, title="Games for Windows Live installation"]
. When finished, just click on *Close*.
+
.Games for Windows Live installation finished
image::DEFCON-00-Games-for-Windows-Live-installation-finished.png[Games for Windows Live installation finished, title="Games for Windows Live installation finished"]
. Try to run the game again. The dreaded compatibility assistant shows itself again. However, this time tick the option *Don't show this message again* and then click on *Close*.
+
.The compatibility assistant, again
image::DEFCON-00-Compatibility-Assistant-again.png[The compatibility assistant, again, title="The compatibility assistant, again"]
. Now, click on *Play* in the launcher.
+
._Fallout 3_ launcher, ready for action
image::DEFCON-00-Fallout-3-launcher-ready.png[Fallout 3 launcher, ready for action, title="Fallout 3 launcher, ready for action"]
. Success! The first step in our modding journey is over.
+
._Fallout 3_ main menu
image::DEFCON-00-Fallout-3-main-menu.png[Fallout 3 main menu, title="Fallout 3 main menu"]
. This is all we need, for now. Just click on *Quit* and check this files and folders under `[$USERPROFILE\Documents\My Games\Fallout3]` (`[$USERPROFILE\My Documents\My Games\Fallout3]`, if you are using Windows 7):
* `[Saves]`
* `FALLOUT3.INI`
* `FalloutPrefs.ini`
* `RendererInfo.txt`




=== Installing the tools

[NOTE]
====
These are the tools installed in this chapter, in alphabetical order.

* https://loot.github.io/[LOOT].
* http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1334/[Mod Organizer].
* http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/11336/[Wrye Flash].
* http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/2737/[xEdit].
====

In this chapter we are going to install the tools we need to mod _Fallout 3 Game of the Year Edition_. We are going to install them, but we are not going to test them; not yet, at least. Their integration will be addressed in the next chapter.




==== LOOT

https://loot.github.io/[Load Order Optimisation Tool] (LOOT) is a tool used to take care of the load order in _The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion_, _The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim_, _The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition_, _Fallout 3_, _Fallout New Vegas_ and _Fallout 4_. Mod Organizer comes with an integrated version of LOOT, but it is outdated, so we are going to need the standalone version installed.

[TIP]
====
If you want to have an in-depth look to LOOT and what it can do, just watch the https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqFCLrYn30c[Start to Finish tutorial about LOOT], by GamerPoets.
====

. https://loot.github.io/[Download] and install LOOT outside UAC-controlled space (for example, `[C:\Games\Tools\LOOT]`). We will refer to the installation folder as `[$LOOT_HOME]`.
. Run LOOT after installing it. When it is run for the first time, a window will appear with some tips. Just click *OK* to dismiss it.
+
.LOOT first run
image::DEFCON-00-LOOT-first-run.png[LOOT first run, title="LOOT first run"]
. LOOT usually does a good job detecting the installed games which it considers manageable, so there is a good chance that _Fallout 3_ would be automatically detected.
+
.LOOT with Vanilla game
image::DEFCON-00-LOOT-with-Vanilla-game.png[LOOT with Vanilla game, title="LOOT with Vanilla game"]
. *DON'T DO ANYTHING BUT EXIT LOOT!* We are going to manage the load order through Mod Organizer, so this will be the last time we run LOOT standalone.




==== xEdit

http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/2737/[xEdit] is not really a single tool, but a set of tools with different names and equivalent purpose. There are versions of xEdit for several games (FO3Edit for _Fallout 3_, TES5Edit for _The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim_, and son on), but they all do the same thing: manipulate game plugins (`.esm` and `.esp` files).

[TIP]
====
Although we are going to use a limited set of features in xEdit, it's worth checking the https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F19Do8HAl4[Start to Finish tutorial about xEdit], by GamerPoets.
====

The version you have to use will always be the last one, and in this case, it is the _Fallout 4_ version, called FO4Edit, of course.

So, why the renaming? Why xEdit instead of FO4Edit? It is because we are planning for the future. We would like to use xEdit to manipulate not only _Fallout 3_ plugins, but also plugins from any other Bethesda's (or Obsidian's) game which the tool would be able to manage.

. http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/2737/[Download] and install FO4Edit outside UAC-controlled space, using the name "xEdit" (for example, `[C:\Games\Tools\xEdit]`). We will refer to the installation folder as `[$XEDIT_HOME]`. The tool is packed in a ZIP file, so the only thing you have to do is unpack it into the desired location.
. Rename the file `FO4Edit.exe` inside `[$XEDIT_HOME]` to `xEdit.exe`.
. If you try to run xEdit, an error is shown because the tool has not been instructed about which game is about to fiddle with.
+
.xEdit error when running standalone
image::DEFCON-00-xEdit-first-time-run-error.png[xEdit error when running standalone, title="xEdit error when running standalone"]
. However, the tool launches with no plugins loaded.
+
.xEdit with no plugins loaded
image::DEFCON-00-xEdit-first-time-run.png[xEdit with no plugins loaded, title="xEdit with no plugins loaded"]
. Just exit xEdit. We are going to use this tool through Mod Organizer also.




==== Wrye Flash

I'll try to keep it simple... http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/11336/[Wrye Flash] is a modding utility roughly equivalent to Mod Organizer or Nexus Mod Manager. However, it comes out-of-the-box with a feature that makes it most valuable: the management of bash tags and, hence, the creation of bashed patches. In fact, it is the only feature we are going to use here.

Besides, what is a bash tag or, for that matter, a bashed patch?

Bash tag::
It is an element that points out which http://geck.bethsoft.com/index.php?title=Category:Leveled_Lists[leveled lists] are modified by a mod. Items belonging to a leveled list are presented to the player according to her level in the game.

Bashed patch::
It is a sort of compatibility patch between mods, but it revolves around leveled lists, using the bash tags included in these mods.

//^

. http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/11336/[Download] Wrye Flash, using the [NexusFile]*Wrye Flash 31.6 - Standalone Executable* file, as of this writing.
. Unzip the file in a location of your choice. The ZIP file contains two folders, `[Data]` and `[Mopy]`.
. Copy the two folders to `[$FO3_HOME]` (remember: your _Fallout 3_ installation folder).
. A warning will appear, because we are trying to overwrite the data folder with additional content. Yeah, I know I said that we would keep our data folder clean, but this is the only way Wrye Flash would work, so you have to overwrite the game data folder when asked to. This will be the last time, I swear.
+
.Wrye Flash data folder replacement
image::DEFCON-00-Wrye-Flash-data-folder-replacement.png[Wrye Flash data folder replacement, title="Wrye Flash data folder replacement"]
. Run `Wrye Flash.exe` from `[$FO3_HOME\Mopy]`.
+

. Wrye Flash will show an initial error. Just ignore it.
+
.Wrye Flash initial error
image::DEFCON-00-Wrye-Flash-initial-error.png[Wrye Flash initial error, title="Wrye Flash initial error"]
. After a brief moment, Wrye Flash will be loaded, showing your actual mod list (only official DLCs for the moment). Don't worry about what you see, and *DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING!* Just exit the tool.
+

image::DEFCON-00-Wrye-Flash-first-run.png[Wrye Flash first run, title="Wrye Flash first run"]
. We have unintentionally left a small detritus in the data folder: a bashed patch template. This is a mock `.esp` file called `Bashed Patch, 0.esp` which Wrye Flash places in the data folder when run in standalone mode.
+

==== Mod Organizer

Finally, our touchstone: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1334/[Mod Organizer]. We are just going to install MO in this sub-chapter, taking care about the integration between all the tools in the <<Setting up the environment, next chapter>>.

[TIP]
====
We are going to use and abuse MO _ad nauseam_, but you can get a feeling of what it is and how to install it in these two videos, by Gopher, both part of a https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7DlYarj-DcLS9LyjEqOJwFUQIIQewcK[larger playlist about MO]:

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4ZQpzf_iAE&index=1&list=PLE7DlYarj-DcLS9LyjEqOJwFUQIIQewcK[Mod Organizer: Introduction].
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYY1OV2_ZTk&index=2&list=PLE7DlYarj-DcLS9LyjEqOJwFUQIIQewcK[Mod Organizer #1 - Installation and Initial Setup.]
====

. http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1334/[Download] the last version of Mod Organizer using the [NexusFile]*Mod Organizer v1_3_11 installer* file, as of this writing.
. Run the installer, which shows an assistant to guide you through the installation. Advance to the screen in which you should choose the components to install. Make sure you have the *Handle Nexus Links* option checked in order to download Nexus mod files right from MO.
+
.Mod Organizer components
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-components.png[Mod Organizer components, title="Mod Organizer components"]
. In the next screen, select `[$FO3_HOME\Mod Organizer]` as the installation folder. Yes, we are going to install MO *inside* the _Fallout 3_ main folder, and it is the best way to do it.
+
.Mod Organizer installation folder
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-installation-folder.png[Mod Organizer installation folder, title="Mod Organizer installation folder"]
. Once the tool is in place, run Mod Organizer. The application will ask you to select the game version you have. You should choose _Game Of The Year_.
+
.Mod Organizer game version selection
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-game-version-selection.png[Mod Organizer game version selection, title="Mod Organizer game version selection"]
. A window with the message of the day will appear. Just click *OK*.
+
.Mod Organizer message of the day
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-message-of-the-day.png[Mod Organizer message of the day, title="Mod Organizer message of the day"]

+
.Mod Organizer first run
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-first-run.png[Mod Organizer first run, title="Mod Organizer first run"]
. Don't do anything right now, but leave MO open.




=== Setting up the environment

We have installed all the tools we need so far, but they are just bits and pieces left fending for themselves. What we are going to do in this chapter is to glue them together so that they work seamlessly in a solid, stable modding environment.

[TIP]
====
There is a great video about https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLWMvEg2LxwXbtc-mZT_H9pOwhIdOcMcn9&v=GeEz564qCpc[installing and stitching together all the tools], by Dirty Weasel Media. It is part of a https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWMvEg2LxwXbtc-mZT_H9pOwhIdOcMcn9[larger playlist about modding _Fallout 3_ with Mod Organizer].
====

The setup has been divided in several parts to make it easier to follow.




==== Creating a proper shortcut

We need a shortcut to MO to run the tool with ease, because we are going to launch the game using MO, _with no exceptions_. It may seem a bit overkill at first, at least when you have the game fully modded, but trust me, you would like to know exactly which profile, and therefore which mods, are you going to load.

. Navigate with windows Explorer to `[$FO3_HOME\Mod Organizer]` and grab `Mod Organizer.exe` with the right mouse button, dropping it in your desktop, then selecting *Create shortcuts here*.
+
.Creating a shortcut to Mod Organizer
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-create-shortcut.png[Creating a shortcut to Mod Organizer, title="Creating a shortcut to Mod Organizer"]
. Rename the shortcut to something meaningful, like "FO3-MO", for example. We are planning for the future again, because we are going to use Mod Organizer for _Fallout New Vegas_ and _The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion_.
+
.Mod Organizer renamed shortcut
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-renamed-shortcut.png[Mod Organizer renamed shortcut, title="Mod Organizer renamed shortcut"]
. The default icon for MO is not that bad, but now we are customizing our environment, why stop here? Let's change the icon to show the game we are dealing with. Download the http://www.iconarchive.com/download/i297/3xhumed/mega-games-pack-23/Fallout-3-new-1.ico[ICO version] of http://www.iconarchive.com/show/mega-games-pack-23-icons-by-3xhumed/Fallout-3-new-1-icon.html[this icon] from http://www.iconarchive.com/tag/fallout[the Icon Archive].
. Right-click on the MO icon and select *Properties*. Don't pay attention to the shitload of options I have in my contextual menu. Your mileage may vary.
+
.Context menu for the Mod Organizer icon
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-shortcut-context-menu.png[Context menu for the Mod Organizer icon, title="Context menu for the Mod Organizer icon"]
. In the properties window, click on *Change Icon...*.
+
.Mod Organizer shortcut properties
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-shortcut-properties.png[Mod Organizer shortcut properties, title="Mod Organizer shortcut properties"]
. In the dialog to choose an icon, select *Browse...*.
+
.Mod Organizer icon selection dialog
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-browse-icon.png[Mod Organizer icon selection dialog, title="Mod Organizer icon selection dialog"]
. Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the new icon and select it.
+
.Selecting a new icon for the FO3-MO shortcut
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-new-icon-selection.png[Selecting a new icon for the FO3-MO shortcut, title="Selecting a new icon for the FO3-MO shortcut"]
. Back to the icon selection dialog, just click *OK*.
+
.Mod Organizer icon confirmation
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-new-icon-confirmation.png[Mod Organizer icon confirmation, title="Mod Organizer icon confirmation"]
. Finally, click *OK* on the shortcut properties dialog to confirm the changes.

.Confirming the changes made to the FO3-MO shortcut
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-shortcut-properties-confirmation.png[Confirming the changes made to the FO3-MO shortcut, title="Confirming the changes made to the FO3-MO shortcut"]

==== Mod Organizer basic setup

By now, we have everything in place, but we have not started with the real deal yet. Let's begin now.

[TIP]
====
Check this video about https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdZffZnYvL4&list=PLWMvEg2LxwXbtc-mZT_H9pOwhIdOcMcn9&index=1[installing and setting up Mod Organizer], by Dirty Weasel Media.
====

. Launch MO with the shortcut we have just created. You can see the http://wiki.step-project.com/Guide:Mod_Organizer#Left_Pane[left pane] and the http://wiki.step-project.com/Guide:Mod_Organizer#Right_Pane[right pane]. The left pane contains our mod stack, sorted by priority (the higher the number, the higher the priority), while the right pane contains our load order, also sorted by priority, with just the `.esm` and `.esp` files.
+
.Mod Organizer panes
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-panes.png[Mod Organizer panes, title="Mod Organizer panes"]
. There is something a bit off with the information shown in both panes: the order is not right. Somehow, MO does not know how to sort the main file and official DLCs right off the hook. Let's start by correcting the priority order in the left pane by dragging and dropping the official mods until you have this:
  * Unmanaged: Fallout3
  * Unmanaged: Anchorage
  * Unmanaged: ThePitt
  * Unmanaged: BrokenSteel
  * Unmanaged: PointLookout
  * Unmanaged: Zeta
+
.Corrected priority order in Mod Organizer
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-corrected-priority-order.png[Corrected priority order in Mod Organizer, title="Corrected priority order in Mod Organizer"]
. Do the same with the load order in the right pane, dragging and dropping the plugins. You should have this:
  * `Fallout3.esm` (you cannot move this, anyway)
  * `Anchorage.esm`
  * `ThePitt.esm`
  * `BrokenSteel.esm`
  * `PointLookout.esm`
  * `Zeta.esm`
+
.Corrected load order in MO
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-corrected-load-order.png[Corrected load order in Mod Organizer, title="Corrected load order in Mod Organizer"]
. We are working with the default profile, so we are going to rename it to show we are working with the Vanilla, unmodded game. Click on the profiles button which lies in the left-hand side of the toolbar.
+
.Mod Organizer profiles button
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-profiles-button.png[Mod Organizer profiles button, title="Mod Organizer profiles button"]
. In the profiles management window, select the "Default" profile and click on *Rename*.
+
.Mod Organizer profiles management window
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-profiles-management-window.png[Mod Organizer profiles management window, title="Mod Organizer profiles management window"]
. Rename the profile to "DEFCON 00 (Vanilla)" and click *OK*.
+
.Renamed Vanilla profile in Mod Organizer
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-renamed-Vanilla-profile.png[Renamed Vanilla profile in Mod Organizer, title="Renamed Vanilla profile in Mod Organizer"]
. Back to the profiles management window, activate the option *Automatic Archive Invalidation*. Otherwise, you won't be able to install any mod! Finally, click on *Close*.
+
.Mod Organizer automatic archive invalidation
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-automatic-archive-invalidation.png[Mod Organizer automatic archive invalidation, title="Mod Organizer automatic archive invalidation"]
. You can see the renamed profile in the dropdown just below the toolbar, above the priority list.
+
.Mod Organizer Vanilla profile
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-Vanilla-profile.png[Mod Organizer Vanilla profile, title="Mod Organizer Vanilla profile"]
. Switch to the *Archives* tab in the right pane and make sure the option *Have MO manage archives* is activated and the file `Fallout - Invalidation.bsa` is at the top (if it is not, don't worry, we'll fix that in a moment).
+
.Archive management activated in Mod Organizer
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-archive-management-activated.png[Archive management activated in Mod Organizer, title="Archive management activated in Mod Organizer"]
. Let's sift through the options we need to change. Click on the settings button at the toolbar.
+
.Mod Organizer settings button
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-settings-button.png[Mod Organizer settings button, title="Mod Organizer settings button"]
. In the *General* tab adjust at least the following settings:
  * Activate the *Advanced* option.
  * If possible, select a download directory in an alternate location, outside your `[$FO3_HOME]` folder.
  * Activate *Download Meta Information*.
+
.Mod Organizer general settings
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-general-settings.png[Mod Organizer general settings, title="Mod Organizer general settings"]
. In the *Nexus* tab, adjust at least the following settings:
  * Activate the *Automatic Log-In to Nexus* option.
  * Use your username and password from Nexus to authenticate.
  * Click on the *Associate with "Download with manager" links* button.
+
.Mod Organizer Nexus settings
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-Nexus-settings.png[Mod Organizer Nexus settings, title="Mod Organizer Nexus settings"]
. In the *Plugins* tab, select the plugin "BSA Extractor" and, in the right pane, switch the "enabled" status from "False" to "True".
+
.Mod Organizer plugins settings
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-plugins-settings.png[Mod Organizer plugins settings, title="Mod Organizer plugins settings"]
. In the *Workarounds* tab, adjust at least the following settings and click *OK*.
  * Change the NMM version to the latest available (you can find out the latest version in the http://www.nexusmods.com/games/[Nexus main page], at the topmost bar, in the http://www.nexusmods.com/games/mods/modmanager/[Install NMM] link).
  * Disable the option *Force-enable game files*.
+
.Nexus Mod Manager latest version
image::DEFCON-00-NMM-version.png[Nexus Mod Manager latest version, title="Nexus Mod Manager latest version"]
+
.Mod Organizer workarounds settings
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-workarounds-settings.png[Mod Organizer workarounds settings, title="Mod Organizer workarounds settings"]
. Back to the MO main window, click on the options dropdown and select *Refresh*.
+
.Mod Organizer refresh settings
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-refresh-settings.png[Mod Organizer refresh settings, title="Mod Organizer refresh settings"]
. After refreshing, you may notice a subtle change. In the *Plugins* tab of the right pane, the file `Fallout3.esm` is no longer grayed out (because we disabled the *Force-enable game files* option in the workaround settings), therefore we can drag and drop it like the rest of the files (don't do that, though).
+
.Mod Organizer main _Fallout 3_ file active
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-main-Fallout-3-file-active.png[Mod Organizer main Fallout 3 file active, title="Mod Organizer main Fallout 3 file active"]
. Remember the `Fallout - Invalidation.bsa` we mentioned before? If it was out of place, it shouldn't be grayed out now, so you can move it around.
+
.Mod Organizer invalidation file active
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-invalidation-file-active.png[Mod Organizer invalidation file active, title="Mod Organizer invalidation file active"]
. Let's check everything is alright by running the Vanilla game through MO. With the game selected in the big dropdown above the right pane (it should be selected by default), just click on the *Run* button.
+
.Mod Organizer internal program launcher
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-internal-program-launcher.png[Mod Organizer internal program launcher, title="Mod Organizer internal program launcher"]
. Mod Organizer may show a dialog about elevated privileges, although we have installed everything outside UAC-controlled space. If so, just click on *Yes* and go on.
+
.Mod Organizer elevated privileges dialog
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-elevated-privileges.png[Mod Organizer elevated privileges dialog, title="Mod Organizer elevated privileges dialog"]
. Finally, here it is: _Fallout 3_ running through MO!
+
._Fallout 3_ Vanilla running through Mod Organizer
image::DEFCON-00-Fallout-3-Vanilla-through-Mod-Organizer.png[Fallout 3 Vanilla running through Mod Organizer, title="Fallout 3 Vanilla running through Mod Organizer"]
. Click on *Quit* to move on to the following chapters, where we are going to integrate our toolset with MO.




==== Integrating LOOT with Mod Organizer

We have a viable modding environment through MO so far, but we need to add the installed tools to the mix in order to have a full-fledged environment. The first piece will be LOOT.

. Mod Organizer does a good job detecting the previously installed LOOT, as you can see in the executables dropdown just above the right pane.
+
.LOOT has already been detected by Mod Organizer
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-detected-LOOT.png[LOOT has already been detected by Mod Organizer, title="LOOT has already been detected by Mod Organizer"]
. However, we have installed just one copy of LOOT, so that we can use it to manage the load order in several games. We need to instruct MO to use _Fallout 3_ in this case. Click on the executables settings button in the top bar.
+
.Mod Organizer executables settings button
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-executables-settings-button.png[Mod Organizer executables settings button, title="Mod Organizer executables settings button"]
. There should be only two entries in the list, one for the game itself and the other for LOOT. Select the LOOT entry and write in the *Arguments* field "--game=Fallout3", without quotations; then, click on *Modify*.
+
.LOOT launch arguments within Mod Organizer
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-LOOT-launch-arguments.png[LOOT launch arguments within Mod Organizer, title="LOOT launch arguments within Mod Organizer"]
. The executables management window won't close, so click on *Close* to dismiss it.
+
.Mod Organizer executables management
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-LOOT-executable-properties-modified.png[Mod Organizer executables management, title="Mod Organizer executables management"]
. Back to the main window, select LOOT in the executables dropdown menu and click on *Run*.
+
.Select LOOT to run through Mod Organizer
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-select-LOOT-and-run.png[Select LOOT to run through Mod Organizer, title="Select LOOT to run through Mod Organizer"]
. When LOOT finishes launching, notice the game tag at the top, which should say "Fallout 3". Also, notice the message "N/A: No masterlist present" in both *Masterlist Revision* and *Masterlist Date*, meaning we have yet to run the tool. Let's fix that by clicking on the sorting icon (image:DEFCON-00-LOOT-sorting-icon.png[LOOT sorting icon, title="LOOT sorting icon"]), at the top bar.
+
.LOOT running through Mod Organizer
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-running-LOOT.png[LOOT running throug Mod Organizer, title="LOOT running throug Mod Organizer"]
. Several things happen _very fast_.
  * A floating message appears, showing that LOOT is updating and using the masterlist to sort your plugins.
+
.LOOT updating and parsing masterlist
image::DEFCON-00-LOOT-updating-and-parsing-masterlist.png[LOOT updating and parsing masterlist, title="LOOT updating and parsing masterlist"]
  * If you sorted the game plugins in the MO right pane like <<Mod Organizer basic setup, you have been instructed to>>, LOOT should show a message pointing out that your load order is untouched.
+
.LOOT made no changes to your load order (as it should be)
image::DEFCON-00-LOOT-no-changes-to-load-order.png[LOOT made no changes to your load order (as it should be), title="LOOT made no changes to your load order (as it should be)"]
  * In the general information pane, both entries regarding the masterlist should show updated information.
+
.Masterlist information has been updated in LOOT
image::DEFCON-00-LOOT-masterlist-updated.png[Masterlist information has been updated in LOOT, title="Masterlist information has been updated in LOOT"]
  * All your plugins, except the main `Fallout3.esm` file, should show a warning message about dirty things FO3Edit has found and need to be cleaned up. Don't worry about them, for now. We are going to address that in the chapter about <<Cleaning up the master files, cleaning up the master files>>.
+
.LOOT shows the official DLC plugins are dirty
image::DEFCON-00-LOOT-dirty-plugin-message.png[LOOT shows the official DLC plugins are dirty, title="LOOT shows the official DLC plugins are dirty"]
. Close LOOT to go back to the MO main window. We are going to put a shortcut in the top-right toolbar to launch LOOT effortlessly. With LOOT selected in the executables dropdown, select *Toolbar* in the *Shortcut* dropdown below the *Run* button.
+
.Option to create a LOOT shortcut in the Mod Organizer toolbar
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-creating-LOOT-shortcut.png[Option to create a LOOT shortcut in the Mod Organizer toolbar, title="Option to create a LOOT shortcut in the Mod Organizer toolbar"]
. Notice the LOOT icon we have just created in the top-right toolbar. We will use this shortcut to launch LOOT from now on, leaving the executables dropdown with the game selected.
+
.LOOT shortcut in Mod Organizer
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-LOOT-shortcut.png[LOOT shortcut in Mod Organizer, title="LOOT shortcut in Mod Organizer"]




==== Disabling the "Sort" button

You may have noticed a button named *Sort* just above the right pane in MO (image:DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-sort-button.png[Mod Organizer sort button, title="Mod Organizer sort button"]). This button launches a built-in feature that sorts your plugins using an outdated version of the LOOT API. We don't want to inadvertently spoil our load order using the wrong tool, because we have the full version of LOOT just to do that, so let's disable this button.

. Navigate to the `[$FO3_HOME\Mod Organizer]` folder, and rename or delete the folder `[loot]` which is under that path.
+
.Mod Organizer built-in LOOT folder
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-built-in-LOOT-folder.png[Mod Organizer built-in LOOT folder, title="Mod Organizer built-in LOOT folder"]
. After deleting or renaming the folder, click on the *Sort* button in MO. The application should show an error.
+
.Error launching Mod Organizer built-in LOOT
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-error-launching-built-in-LOOT.png[Error launching Mod Organizer built-in LOOT, title="Error launching Mod Organizer built-in LOOT"]
. MO shows another dialog pointing out that the built-in LOOT couldn't be launched. Just what we wanted.
+
.Mod Organizer failed to launch the built-in LOOT, as expected
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-failed-to-start-LOOT.png[Mod Organizer failed to launch the built-in LOOT, as expected, title="Mod Organizer failed to launch the built-in LOOT"]




==== Integrating xEdit with Mod Organizer

xEdit will be the next tool we are going to integrate within our modding environment. Unlike LOOT, it is not automatically detected when installed.

. Click on the executables settings button, like we did before to modify LOOT properties.
+
.Mod Organizer executables settings button
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-executables-settings-button.png[Mod Organizer executables settings button, title="Mod Organizer executables settings button"]
. Fill in the following fields to provide the necessary information to run xEdit and click on *Add*:
  * *Title*: "xEdit", without the quotations.
  * *Binary*: the xEdit executable path (like `$XEDIT_HOME\xEdit.exe`).
  * *Arguments*: "-FO3", without the quotations (there is http://wiki.step-project.com/Guide:XEdit#Launch_Arguments[a good bunch of command-line arguments]).
+
.xEdit executable information in Mod Organizer
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-creating-xEdit-executable-entry.png[xEdit executable information in Mod Organizer, title="xEdit executable information in Mod Organizer"]
. The executables settings window remains open, so click on *Close* after checking that a xEdit entry has been created.
+
.xEdit entry created in Mod Organizer
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-xEdit-entry-created.png[xEdit entry created in Mod Organizer, title="xEdit entry created in Mod Organizer"]
. Back in the MO main window, head to the executables drop-down and select xEdit.
+
.Selecting xEdit executable in Mod Organizer
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-select-xEdit-executable.png[Selecting xEdit executable in Mod Organizer, title="Selecting xEdit executable in Mod Organizer"]
. With xEdit selected, click on the *Shortcuts* drop-down and select *Toolbar* to create a shortcut on the top right button bar.
+
.Creating a shortcut for xEdit in Mod Organizer
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-creating-xEdit-shortcut.png[Creating a shortcut for xEdit in Mod Organizer, title="Creating a shortcut for xEdit in Mod Organizer"]
. Launch xEdit by clicking on the newly created toolbar icon.
+
.xEdit toolbar icon in Mod Organizer
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-xEdit-toolbar-icon.png[xEdit toolbar icon in Mod Organizer, title="xEdit toolbar icon in Mod Organizer"]
. xEdit will show the plugin selection window, with all official data files checked. Leave them checked and click *OK*.
+
.xEdit plugin selection window
image::DEFCON-00-xEdit-plugin-selection.png[xEdit plugin selection window, title="xEdit plugin selection window"]
. xEdit starts loading all your data files, and it will take a bit. After it finishes, notice the following:
  * The window title says "FO3Edit", thus recognizing we are using the tool to manage _Fallout 3_ plugins.
  * The left pane contains all the plugins you selected, in the right load order.
  * The right pane should end with the message "Background Loader: finished".
+
.xEdit first run under Mod Organizer
image::DEFCON-00-xEdit-first-time-run-under-Mod-Organizer.png[xEdit first run under Mod Organizer, title="xEdit first run under Mod Organizer"]
. Exit xEdit and get back to the main MO window. Notice a warning sign that suddenly appears in the icon area of the top bar.
+
.Warning sign after exiting xEdit in Mod Organizer
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-warning-after-exiting-xEdit.png[Warning sign after exiting xEdit in Mod Organizer, title="Warning sign after exiting xEdit in Mod Organizer"]
. If you click on the warning icon, a window will appear. In that window MO informs us that there are files in your http://wiki.step-project.com/Guide:Mod_Organizer#Overwrite[overwrite mod]. Click on the line showing the issue to get a full text describing what is happening. Click *Close* when you are ready to take action.
+
.Mod Organizer full warning contents after exiting xEdit
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-overwrite-mod-after-xEdit.png[Mod Organizer full warning contents after exiting xEdit, title="Mod Organizer full warning contents after exiting xEdit"]
. The overwrite mod is where external programs, like xEdit, put their output contents when run through MO. Double-click on the overwrite mod access in the left pane to view its contents.
+
.Overwrite mod access in Mod Organizer
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-overwrite-mod-access.png[Overwrite mod access in Mod Organizer, title="Overwrite mod access in Mod Organizer"]
. MO shows a window with the contents of the overwrite mod. It should have only an empty folder named `[FO3Edit Backups]` (if the folder has contents, you touched something you shouldn't in xEdit). Right-click on the folder name and select *Delete*. We don't need this folder, for now, although we are going to use the contents of this special mod in the future.
+
.Deleting the overwrite mod after running xEdit
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-overwrite-mod-contents-after-xEdit.png[Deleting the overwrite mod after running xEdit, title="Deleting the overwrite mod after running xEdit"]
. MO asks for confirmation before deleting the folder. Just click *Yes*.
+
.Mod Organizer asks for confirmation before deleting xEdit backup
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-xEdit-backup-deletion-confirmation.png[Mod Organizer asks for confirmation before deleting xEdit backup, title="Mod Organizer asks for confirmation before deleting xEdit backup"]
. MO shows back the overwrite mod contents, which should be none. Click on *Close*.
+
.Empty overwrite mod in Mod Organizer
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-empty-overwrite-mod.png[Empty overwrite mod in Mod Organizer, title="Empty overwrite mod in Mod Organizer"]
. Finally, check again the warning sign, which should be grayed out, meaning there are no contents in the overwrite mod.
+
.The warning in Mod Organizer has disappeared
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-warning-after-cleaning.png[The warning in Mod Organizer has disappeared, title="The warning in Mod Organizer has disappeared"]




==== Integrating Wrye Flash with Mod Organizer

Wrye Flash is the final tool we need to integrate with Mod Organizer to have a full-fledged modding environment. Let's see how.

. Click on the executables settings button.
+
.Mod Organizer executables settings button
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-executables-settings-button.png[Mod Organizer executables settings button, title="Mod Organizer executables settings button"]
. Fill in the following fields to provide the necessary information to run Wrye Flash and click on *Add*:
  * *Title*: "Wrye Flash", without the quotations.
  * *Binary*: the Wrye Flash executable path (like `$FO3_HOME\Mopy\Wrye Flash.exe`).
+
.Wrye Flash executable information in Mod Organizer
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-creating-Wrye-Flash-executable-entry.png[Wrye Flash executable information in Mod Organizer, title="Wrye Flash executable information in Mod Organizer"]
. The executables settings window remains open, so click on *Close* after checking that a Wrye Flash entry has been created.
+
.Wrye Flash entry created in Mod Organizer
image::DEFCON-00-Mod-Organizer-Wrye-Flash-entry-created.png[Wrye Flash entry created in Mod Organizer, title="Wrye Flash entry created in Mod Organizer"]

== DEFCON 01 (Bug Fixes and Performance)

I know all of you are biting your nails to the bone right now, consumed by impatience, waiting for the real deal to begin.

Well, this is it. This is the chapter where all of the actual modding begins. We created the Vanilla profile in the <<DEFCON 00 (Vanilla), previous chapter>> to build the foundation upon the very rest of the profiles are going to lean on. Now it's time to build our first meaningful profile.

At the end of this chapter, you will have a version of _Fallout 3 Game of the Year Edition_ that:

* Runs flawlessly (well, almost).
* Is patched to the max, with most silly (and not-so-silly) errors corrected.
* Takes advantage of your system memory.
* Has no (or little) micro-stutter.
* Runs in windowed mode, faking full-screen.
* Has a clean set of data files, including a merged and a bashed patch to further ensure compatibility among them.
* Creates saved games automatically and frequently, so that you always have means to recover from a disaster.
* Has a better performance by getting rid of zillions of unused objects (like tiny rocks) which plague the game.
* Has a saved game just before leaving Vault 101, so that you won't have to repeat the initial story in every new playthrough.




=== Creating the profile

The very first thing we are going to do in each main chapter is to create the MO profile which will bind all the chapter mods together. Each *DEFCON* profile will be built upon the previous one, so *DEFCON 00* will be our foundation in this case.

. Launch MO.
. Click on the MO profiles button.
+
.Mod Organizer profiles button
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-profiles-button.png[Mod Organizer profiles button, title="Mod Organizer profiles button"]
. In the profiles management window, select the *DEFCON 00 (Vanilla)* profile and click on *Copy*.
+
.Copying DEFCON 00 profile in Mod Organizer
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-copying-DEFCON-00-profile.png[Copying DEFCON 00 profile in Mod Organizer, title="Copying DEFCON 00 profile in Mod Organizer"]
. In the following window, write "DEFCON 01 (Bug Fixes and Performance)" as the profile name and click *OK*. We will use meaningful names to easily recognize the purpose of each profile.
+
.Naming DEFCON 01 profile in Mod Organizer
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-naming-profile.png[Naming DEFCON 01 profile in Mod Organizer, title="Naming DEFCON 01 profile in Mod Organizer"]
. Back to the profiles management window, check that the *DEFCON 01* profile has been created and click *Close*.
+
.DEFCON 01 profile has been created
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-profile-created.png[DEFCON 01 profile has been created, title="DEFCON 01 profile has been created"]
. MO does not automatically change the profile when it is created, so click on the *Profiles* drop-down and select the "DEFCON 01 (Bug Fixes and Performance)" profile.
+
.Selecting the DEFCON 01 profile
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-selecting-profile.png[Selecting the DEFCON 01 profile, title="Selecting the DEFCON 01 profile"]
. From now on, every operation we perform will be related to this profile.

=== Disable Games for Windows Live

[NOTE]
====
Mods used in this chapter:

* http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/1086/[_Games for Windows LIVE Disabler_]
====

We are using the Steam version of _Fallout 3 Game of the Year Edition_, so there's no need to use Games for Windows Live (or GfWL). Besides, GfWL may cause problems with our game, so it's better to get rid of it.

. Manually download [NexusFile]*Games for Windows LIVE Disable* from http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/1086/[_Games for Windows LIVE disabler_].
+
*DO NOT* use MO to download this tool. Download it manually instead.
. Unzip the contents of the downloaded file in a location of your choice.
. Run the file `Games for Windows LIVE Disabler.exe`.
. In the following window, just click on *Disable G4WL*.
+
.GfWL Disabler in action
image::DEFCON-01-Games-for-Windows-Live-disabler.png[GfWL Disabler in action, title="GfWL Disabler in action"]
. When the disabler asks for removing the "LIVE" button, click on *Yes*.
+
.Of course, we want to remove the "LIVE" button
image::DEFCON-01-Games-for-Windows-Live-disabler-button-removal.png[Of course, we want to remove the "LIVE" button, title="Of course, we want to remove the 'LIVE' button"]
. The disabler informs us everything went as expected. Click on *OK*.
+
.GfWL disabler success
image::DEFCON-01-Games-for-Windows-Live-disabler-success.png[GfWL disabler success, title="GfWL disabler success"]
. Exit GfWL.
. Launch _Fallout 3_ through MO using the *DEFCON 01* profile (you should be able to do that by now). Notice the absent *LIVE* option in the main menu screen.

=== Enabling back Steam Overlay

[NOTE]
====
Mods used in this chapter:

* http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/21364/[_FalloutLauncher Replacer for Steam_]
====

You may have noticed a peculiar absence launching the game through MO: there is no Steam Overlay.

For those of you who have been living in a crab-infested cave to flee from the Steam Season Sales, Steam Overlay is, well, an overlay you can pull up in any Steam hosted game using the keys kbd:[Shift] and kbd:[Tab]. This overlay bundles an integrated browser, a chat, a recount of the time you have been playing the game and so on. I think you get the idea.

If you are interested in getting Steam Overlay back to life, follow these steps:

. Delete the icons you previously created in the desktop to launch _Fallout 3_, both of them. We are going to create a new one.
. Download manually the file [NexusFile]*FalloutLauncher* from http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/21364/[_FalloutLauncher Replacer for Steam_].
. Unzip the file `FalloutLauncher-21364-1-4.zip` (or whatever its name is, depending on the version) in a location of your choice.
. Create an empty file called `FalloutLauncher.ini` in the same folder you have just unzipped the file.
. The zipped file contained just one file, `FalloutLauncher.exe`. Run the program once, which is a console application with three options (standard launcher, FOSE and MO), to fill the INI file with a skeleton template. Just press kbd:[ESC] to exit.
+
.FalloutLauncher Replacer first run
image::DEFCON-01-FalloutLauncherReplacer-first-run.png[FalloutLauncher Replacer first run, title="FalloutLauncher Replacer first run"]
. Open the file `FalloutLauncher.ini` for edition. There are four sections within: `[Fallout Launcher]`, `[FOSE]`, `[Mod Organizer]` and `[Custom]`. We are always going to run the game through MO, so we just need to fill in the `[Mod Organizer]` section. This is how you find that section, fresh like your first morning shit:
+
----
[Mod Organizer]
; Leave empty to ignore
Path=
Arguments=
----
. You just need to set the `Path` property to your `ModOrganizer.exe` location, which should be in `[$FO3_HOME\Mod Organizer]`. This is my version of the entry in `FalloutLauncher.ini`. Modify the `Path` entry as necessary.
+
----
[Mod Organizer]
; Leave empty to ignore
Path=C:\Games\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty\Mod Organizer\ModOrganizer.exe
Arguments=
----
. Now, open the folder `[$FO3_HOME]` and create a backup copy of the file `FalloutLauncher.exe`, which is the official, original launcher.
. Copy the files `FalloutLauncher.exe` and `FalloutLauncher.ini` from the FalloutLauncher Replacer folder to your `[$FO3_HOME]` folder. There should be a `FalloutReplacer.log` file which you can safely ignore. This is how the `[$FO3_HOME]` folder should look after copying the replacement.
+
.FalloutLauncher replacer in place
image::DEFCON-01-FalloutLauncherReplacer-in-place.png[FalloutLauncher replacer in place, title="FalloutLauncher replacer in place"]
. It's time to create a new shortcut to launch the game through the new launcher. Right-click on your Steam icon in the tray bar and select *Library*.
+
.Opening your game library in Steam
image::DEFCON-01-Steam-opening-game-library.png[Opening your game library in Steam, title="Opening your game library in Steam"]
. Once your game library opens, right-click on your _Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition_ entry and select *Properties*.
+
.Opening the _Fallout 3 GOTY_ properties in Steam
image::DEFCON-01-Steam-Fallout-3-opening-properties.png[Opening the Fallout 3 GOTY properties in Steam, title="Opening the Fallout 3 GOTY properties in Steam"]

+
.Opening _Fallout 3 GOTY_ launch options

. The next window warns us that we should be meddling with the options only if we are advanced users, which we are, indeed. Set the launch option `--start mo` to ensure that the new launcher goes through MO and click on *OK*.
+
.Making sure Mod Organizer is launched through Steam
image::DEFCON-01-Steam-Fallout-3-launch-options.png[Making sure Mod Organizer is launched through Steam, title="Making sure Mod Organizer is launched through Steam"]

.The shortcut has been created, of course
image::DEFCON-01-Steam-Fallout-3-shortcut-created.png[The shortcut has been created, of course, title="The shortcut has been created, of course"]

+
._Fallout 3_ launcher icon, with Steam Overlay
image::DEFCON-01-Fallout-3-Steam-Overlay-icon.png[Fallout 3 launcher icon, with Steam Overlay, title="Fallout 3 launcher icon, with Steam Overlay"]

+
.Renaming the icon to its former self
image::DEFCON-01-Fallout-3-Steam-Overlay-icon-renamed.png[Renaming the icon to its former self, title="Renaming the icon to its former self"]
. For the sake of aesthetics, if nothing else, let's change the shortcut to use the icon we downloaded in the chapter about <<Creating a proper shortcut, creating a proper shortcut>>. Right-click on the icon and select *Properties*.
+
.Launching shortcut's properties
image::DEFCON-01-Fallout-3-Steam-Overlay-properties-option.png[Launching shortcut's properties, title="Launching shortcut's properties"]

+
._Fallout 3_ with Steam Overlay shortcut's properties
image::DEFCON-01-Fallout-3-Steam-Overlay-icon-properties.png[Fallout 3 with Steam Overlay shortcut's properties, title="Fallout 3 with Steam Overlay shortcut's properties"]

+
.Crappy default icons we don't give a shit about
image::DEFCON-01-Fallout-3-Steam-Overlay-icon-browse.png[Crappy default icons we don't give a shit about, title="Crappy default icons we don't give a shit about"]
. Select the icon you want to use. I have renamed the `.ico` file we used before to `Fallout3.ico`, but feel free to use whatever icon you feel comfortable with.
+
.Selecting a new icon for the Steam Overlay shortcut
image::DEFCON-01-Fallout-3-Steam-Overlay-icon-selection.png[Selecting a new icon for the Steam Overlay shortcut, title="Selecting a new icon for the Steam Overlay shortcut"]
. With the new icon selected, just click on *OK*.
+
.New shortcut icon selected

. Back again to the properties window, click on *OK* again.
+
.Final touches to the shortcut icon
image::DEFCON-01-Fallout-3-Steam-Overlay-icon-final.png[Final touches to the shortcut icon, title="Final touches to the shortcut icon"]
. So, we have a new brand icon to launch the game through MO with Steam Overlay.
+
.Final icon to launch the game
image::DEFCON-01-Fallout-3-Steam-Overlay-icon-reshaped.png[Final icon to launch the game, title="Final icon to launch the game"]
. What happens when you double-click on the launcher icon? In the end, you will have MO open and ready, but prior to that, two things happen very fast. First, you will briefly see the usual window Steam shows when launching a game.
+
._Fallout 3_ being launched through Steam
image::DEFCON-01-Fallout-3-through-Steam.png[Fallout 3 being launched through Steam, title="Fallout 3 being launched through Steam"]
. Next, you will see an empty _FalloutLauncher Replacer_ window in a flash.
+
.Empty _FalloutLauncher Replacer_ window
image::DEFCON-01-Fallout-3-through-Steam-through-FalloutLauncher-replacer.png[Empty FalloutLauncher Replacer window, title="Empty FalloutLauncher Replacer window"]
. MO finally opens, with your current profile loaded. Now, launch _Fallout 3_ using the *Run* button.
+
.Launching _Fallout 3_ with Steam Overlay
image::DEFCON-01-Fallout-3-through-Steam-through-FalloutLauncher-replacer-through-Mod-Organizer.png[Launching Fallout 3 with Steam Overlay, title="Launching Fallout 3 with Steam Overlay"]
. Now, if you press kbd:[Shift] and kbd:[Tab] while in-game, you will see Steam Overlay in all its electronic glory.
+
.Steam Overlay and _Fallout 3_, finally
image::DEFCON-01-Fallout-3-with-Steam-Overlay.png[Steam Overlay and Fallout 3, finally, title="Steam Overlay and Fallout 3, finally"]

This is it! Now, we have the best of both worlds: Steam and MO. Time to move on!




=== Enabling access to 4 GB+ of memory

[NOTE]
====
Mods used in this chapter:

* http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/6510/[_Large Address Aware Enabler for FO3_]
====

_Fallout 3_ does not use all the available memory it could have used, due to its 32 bits nature (the game was launched in 2008, you know). However, you can modify the game executable to take advantage of all the memory it can get.

[TIP]
====
Gopher explains the way to go with this video about https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tONiXNbwSt0[performance and stability in _Fallout 3_] (26:38) (the video touches several topics, but the one we are focusing on spans from the beginning to 08:55, give or take).
====

We don't want to clutter our system with unnecessary tools, so we are sticking with http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/6510/[_Large Address Aware Enabler for FO3_].

. Manually download the file [NexusFile]*FO3_3GB_ENABLER* from http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/6510/[_Large Address Aware Enabler for FO3_], not using MO, and extract its contents in a location of your choice.
. Create a backup of the file `Fallout3.exe` from `[$FO3_HOME]`, just in case everything goes South.
. Copy the file `Fallout3.exe` to the folder where you extracted the LAA Enabler.
. Run `START.BAT` in the aforementioned folder. A console window will appear, reporting that the patching is about to start. Press any key.
+
.LAA Enabler reminder
image::DEFCON-01-LAA-enabler-reminder.png[LAA Enabler reminder, title="LAA Enabler reminder"]
. Several options are shown. We want to press kbd:[A] to add the LAA feature to _Fallout 3_ executable.
+
.LAA Enabler options
image::DEFCON-01-LAA-enabler-options.png[LAA Enabler options, title="LAA Enabler options"]
. LAA Enabler patches the executable and happily informs us about it. Press any key.
+
.LAA Enabler successful
image::DEFCON-01-LAA-enabler-successful.png[LAA Enabler successful, title="LAA Enabler successful"]
. The program goes back to the options window. Press kbd:[E] to exit.
+
.LAA Enabler finished
image::DEFCON-01-LAA-enabler-finished.png[LAA Enabler finished, title="LAA Enabler finished"]
. Copy back `Fallout3.exe` to its original location in `[$FO3_HOME]`.
. Delete the folder where you extracted the LAA Enabler and its contents. Delete the ZIP file also. You won't need them anymore.

And that's really it. Now _Fallout 3_ is ready to handle more than 2 GB of RAM, improving stability.




=== Setting up the foundation for our modding

[NOTE]
====
Mods used in this chapter:

* http://fose.silverlock.org/[_Fallout Script Extender (FOSE)_]
====

If you ever want to install a single mod in _Fallout 3_, you will need http://fose.silverlock.org/[_Fallout Script Extender_] (FOSE, for short).

Well... That's not exactly true, as there may be mods that does not make use of the capabilities provided by FOSE, and we are going to use a good deal of them. But they will be a minority, and we will need this tool ahead the road.

[TIP]
====
Cal, from DirtyWeasel, has an interesting video about https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdZffZnYvL4&list=PLWMvEg2LxwXbtc-mZT_H9pOwhIdOcMcn9&index=1[setting up MO and FOSE] (40:20) (see around minute https://youtu.be/kdZffZnYvL4?t=24m5s[24:05]).
====

. Make sure MO is closed for the time being.
. Download the latest version of FOSE (http://fose.silverlock.org/beta/fose_v1_3_beta2.7z[1.3b2] as of this writing). It's the beta version, but it has been in that state for ages without noticeable glitches, so I guess that qualifies it as "stable", as far as we are concerned.
. Extract the contents of the archive into a folder of your choice.
. Copy the following files you just extracted to `[$FO3_HOME]`:
* `fose_1_7.dll`
* `fose_1_7ng.dll`
* `fose_editor_1_5.dll`
* `fose_loader.exe`
. Delete the extracted folder and its contents. Delete the ZIP file also. We don't need them anymore.
. One of the many wonderful things MO has is that it automatically detects FOSE when it is placed in the game folder. Run MO and check the launch pane, which should show FOSE by default. Run the game with the *Run* button.
+
.FOSE has been automatically detected
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-FOSE-detected.png[FOSE has been automatically detected, title=""FOSE has been automatically detected]
. In the menu screen, press the key to the left of the kbd:[1] key (I have a Spanish keyboard, so it's the kbd:[º] key; in US keyboards it's the kbd:[~] key) to fire up the console. Write the command `GetFOSEVersion` to get the response `FOSE Version: 1`, which means FOSE is up and running.
+
.Testing FOSE through the game console
image::DEFCON-01-Fallout-3-testing-FOSE.png[Testing FOSE through the game console, title="Testing FOSE through the game console"]
. Exit the game.

FOSE provides a http://fose.silverlock.org/fose_command_doc.html[whole new set of console commands] you can use, although they are not strictly necessary. We have what wee need to start modding, so let's get on with it.




=== Cleaning up the master files

Remember when we said that we would address the problem of the dirty master files in <<Integrating LOOT with Mod Organizer, an earlier chapter>>? Well, it's time to fix that.

Master files in _Fallout 3_ are somewhat dirty. This is what LOOT said about them:

* `Anchorage.esm`: Contains 54 ITM records and 10 deleted references.
* `ThePitt.esm`: Contains 40 ITM records and 5 deleted navmeshes.
* `BrokenSteel.esm`: Contains 275 ITM records, 34 deleted references and 12 deleted navmeshes.
* `PointLookout.esm`: Contains 21 ITM records.
* `Zeta.esm`: Contains 15 ITM records.

ITM records are items which are identical to elements in other master files. They can be considered mostly harmless. Just a bit of redundancy.

On the contrary, deleted references can (and will) fuck up your game, because they are references to objects that _are supposed to be in the game_, but they no longer are, _and no one has marked them as disabled_. So, any mod using a deleted but not disabled reference is going to eventually crash your system. We are talking serious shit here.

However, we are going to cleanse the master files so that they shine as they were intended to.

We are going to use xEdit through MO to clean the master files, but the process is not so straightforward as it is with NMM, albeit it is more polished at the end. I know it does not make any fucking sense. Just bear with me.

. Launch MO, making sure you are using the DEFCON 01 profile.
+
.We need to have the right profile selected
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-making-sure-correct-profile-selected.png[We need to have the right profile selected, title="We need to have the right profile selected"]
. Launch xEdit using the toolbar icon, like we did before.
. Right-click on the Master/Plugin selection window and select _Select none_. We are going to choose the files to clean, one by one.
+
.Deselecting all master files in xEdit
image::DEFCON-01-xEdit-deselecting-all-master-files.png[Deselecting all master files in xEdit, title="Deselecting all master files in xEdit"]
. We need to select the master file every other master file depends on (`Fallout3.esm`) and the master file we are going to clean first (`Anchorage.esm`). Click *OK* when ready:
+
.Selecting the file to clean in xEdit
image::DEFCON-01-xEdit-selecting-file-to-clean.png[Selecting the file to clean in xEdit, title="Selecting the file to clean in xEdit"]
. xEdit takes a while to load the data contained in these files. Wait for the message "Background Loader: finished" to appear in the *Messages* panel.
+
.Master files to clean successfully loaded in xEdit
image::DEFCON-01-xEdit-master-files-loaded.png[Master files to clean successfully loaded in xEdit, title="Master files to clean successfully loaded in xEdit"]
. Right-click on the `Anchorage.esm` node in the left panel tree and select *Apply filter for cleaning*.
+
.Applying filter for cleaning in xEdit
image::DEFCON-01-xEdit-apply-filter-for-cleaning.png[Applying filter for cleaning in xEdit, title="Applying filter for cleaning in xEdit"]
. The filtering may take a little while, depending on how big and dirty the file is. When the filtering is completed, a line with the heading "[Filtering done]" appears in the *Messages* panel. The tree in the left panel shows the files with fancy colors which you don't have to give a fuck, unless you want to delve deeper into the inner workings of the mods.
+
.Filtering done in xEdit
image::DEFCON-01-xEdit-filtering-done.png[Filtering done in xEdit, title="Filtering done in xEdit"]
. First, we are going to remove ITM (_Identical to Master_) records. They are not going to crash the game, but they take up space, and trust me, when you get the I-am-going-to-install-every-fancy-mod-that-crosses-in-my-path spree, you will need as much space as you can get. Right-click on the `Anchorage.esm` node in the left panel tree and select *Remove "Identical to Master" records*.
+
.Removing ITM records in xEdit
image::DEFCON-01-xEdit-removing-ITM-records.png[Removing ITM records in xEdit, title="Removing ITM records in xEdit"]
. Every time you try to change a data file, a big warning appears. But, as seasoned hard-ass mod installers, we are sure as hell of what we are doing. Aren't we?
+
.Modification warning in xEdit
image::DEFCON-01-xEdit-modification-warning.png[Modification warning in xEdit, title="Modification warning in xEdit"]
. After a little while, a message shows up in the *Messages* panel, reporting 43696 records processed and 54 records removed (don't worry if the numbers don't match; your setup may be slightly different, although it's very unlikely).
+
.ITM records deleted in xEdit
image::DEFCON-01-xEdit-ITM-records-deleted.png[ITM records deleted in xEdit, title="ITM records deleted in xEdit"]
. Next, we are going to undelete and disable deleted references... To get rid of these nasty sons of a bitch, right click on the `Anchorage.esm` node in the left panel tree and select *Undelete and Disable References*.
+
.Undeleting and disabling deleted references in xEdit
image::DEFCON-01-xEdit-undeleting-deleted-references.png[Undeleting and disabling deleted references in xEdit, title="Undeleting and disabling deleted references in xEdit"]
. A bit of processing again, and we have another message in the right panel, reporting 43642 records processed and 10 undeleted records.
+
.Undeleted and disabled references in xEdit
image::DEFCON-01-xEdit-undeleted-references.png[Undeleted and disabled references in xEdit, title="Undeleted and disabled references in xEdit"]
. Job done! We just need to save the modified data file. To do that, just click on the close button of the tool window. A pop-up window should appear with _just one file_, the one you have been tinkering with (`Anchorage.esm`, in this case). If more than one file is shown, press kbd:[ESC] or click on the close button and start over again, because you surely screwed up at some point in the process. Anyway, make sure that the option *Backup plugins* is selected before clicking *OK*.
+
.Saving the modified master file in xEdit
image::DEFCON-01-xEdit-saving-master-file.png[Saving the modified master file in xEdit, title="Saving the modified master file in xEdit"]
. Repeat the process for the rest of the master files: `ThePitt.esm`, `BrokenSteel.esm`, `PointLookout.esm` and `Zeta.esm`.
. When you are done cleaning all the files, take a look at the toolbar in MO. Notice the warning that shows up.
+
.Warning after cleaning up the master files
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-warning.png[Warning after cleaning up the master files, title="Warning after cleaning up the master files"]
. Things are getting interesting here. MO is warning us that xEdit has put contents in the overwrite folder, like <<Integrating xEdit with Mod Organizer, we saw before>>. We are going to deal with it, but first right-click on any empty part in the left pane and select *Refresh*.
+

+
.The official DLCs have gone AWOL
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-missing-plugins.png[The official DLCs have gone AWOL, title="The official DLCs have gone AWOL"]
. Well, they have gone to the overwrite mod folder of MO. Double-click at the bottom of your now derisory plugins list to take a look at the contents of that folder.
+
.Missing master files in the overwrite folder
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-master-files-in-overwrite.png[Missing master files in the overwrite folder, title="Missing master files in the overwrite folder"]
. The master files you see are the _cleaned ones_. Click on the folder `FO3Edit Backups` to see the original, dirty master files.
+
.Original master files in the overwrite folder
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-original-master-files-in-overwrite.png[Original master files in the overwrite folder, title="Original master files in the overwrite folder"]
. What we need to do now involves some tinkering _outside_ MO, so click on *Close* and then exit MO.
. Remember that our cornerstone in modding the game is the very concept of consecration of the data folder, meaning its contents should not be altered. Thus, we are going to _restore_ the original master files, creating a special mod with the cleaned version of these master files. Open the overwrite mod folder, located in `[$FO3_HOME\Mod Organizer\overwrite]`.
+
.The contents of the overwrite mod folder
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-overwrite-folder-contents.png[The contents of the overwrite mod folder, title="The contents of the overwrite mod folder"]
. Now open the `FO3Edit Backups` folder.
+
.The backup of the master files
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-overwrite-folder-backups.png[The backup of the master files, title="The backup of the master files"]
. _Rename_ all the files, stripping out the part after `.esm`. Thus, `Anchorage.esm.backup.2017_01_22_10_45_09` would become `Anchorage.esm`, and so on. Your filenames will be different because the part we are wiping out is sort of a timestamp of the moment the backup was created.
+
.Renamed master files in the overwrite mod folder
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-renamed-master-files.png[Renamed master files in the overwrite mod folder, title="Renamed master files in the overwrite mod folder"]
. _Move back_ the `.esm` files we just renamed to the `[$FO3_HOME\Data]` folder, where they belong. Remember, we are restoring the original, dirty files in its original location.
+
.Original master files restored in its location
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-original-master-files-restores.png[Original master files restored in its location, title="Original master files restored in its location"]
. Let's go back to the overwrite mod folder (`[$FO3_HOME\Mod Organizer\overwrite]`). We need to get rid of the backup folder. Delete it. Burn it to the ground and make sure the only contents of the folder are the cleaned master files.
+
.Cleaned master files, ready to be packed
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-master-files-ready-to-pack.png[Cleaned master files, ready to be packed, title="Cleaned master files, ready to be packed"]
. Launch MO again. The stacking order is scrambled again, but don't worry about it now. We'll deal with this issue in a moment.
+
.Our stacking order is scrambled again
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-scrambled-stacking-order.png[Our stacking order is scrambled again, title="Our stacking order is scrambled again"]
. Right-click on the *Overwrite* stripe at the bottom of the left pane and select *Create mod...*.
+
.Creating a mod with the cleaned master files
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-creating-mod-overwrite.png[Creating a mod with the cleaned master files, title="Creating a mod with the cleaned master files"]

image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-overwrite-mod-name.png[Giving a meaningful name to the cleaned master files mod, title="Giving a meaningful name to the cleaned master files mod"]
. _Et voilà!_ You can notice two things immediately:
  * There is a new mod at the bottom of the stack with the name we just gave, although it has not been activated yet.
  * The warning sign in the top-right toolbar is grayed out again.
+
.This is our first mod! Really!
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-cleaned-master-files-inactive.png[This is our first mod! Really!, title="This is our first mod! Really!"]
+
.We can breathe with relief now
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-grayed-out-warning-sign.png[We can breathe with relief now, title="We can breathe with relief now"]
. Nevertheless, we are not done yet. Rearrange the stacking order in the left pane to match the load order in the right pane, by means of dragging and dropping the plugins.
+
.Rearranged master files
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-rearranged-master-files.png[Rearranged master files, title="Rearranged master files"]
. Finally, activate the *Cleaned Master Files* plugin in the left pane. You will notice http://wiki.step-project.com/Guide:Mod_Organizer#Left_Pane[a bunch of icons] to the right of each plugin (they were there right from the start, but this is the ideal moment for an explanation), meaning:
  * A lightning with a plus sign (image:DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-lightning-plus.png[Lightning with a plus sign, title="Lightning with a plus sign"]) means the plugin overwrites files from other plugins, but its files are not overwritten by anything (what I call a "winner plugin").
  * A lightning with a minus sign (image:DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-lightning-minus.png[Lightning with a minus sign, title="Lightning with a minus sign"]) means some of the files in the plugin are overwritten by files from other plugin, and it does not overwrite files from other plugins (what I call a "loser plugin").
  * A lightning with both a plus and a minus sign (image:DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-lightning-plus-minus.png[Lightning with both a plus and a minus sign, title="Lightning with both a plus and a minus sign"]) means a combination of the two previous states; some of the plugin files are overwritten, and it overwrites some files from other plugins (what I call an "average plugin").
  * A lightning with no additional signs (image:DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-lightning.png[Lightning with no sign, title="Lightning with no sign"]) means the plugin has all its files overwritten by other plugins, and it does not overwrite any file from other plugins, actually rendering it useless (what I call a "disposable plugin"). There should be no disposable plugins in our stack.
  * If the plugin does not have any sign, it means its files are untouched (what I call an "isolated plugin").
+
.Cleaned master files plugin activated
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-cleaned-master-files-activated.png[Cleaned master files plugin activated, title="Cleaned master files plugin activated"]
. Let's check what is being overwritten by our brand-new mod. Double-click on it and navigate to the *Conflicts* tab where you can see:
  * In the upper pane there is a list of the files overwritten by this mod. In this case, each of the original master files.
  * In the lower pane there is a list of the mod files overwritten by other mods. There are none, in this case.
+
.Original master files overwritten by the first mod
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-overwritten-files-cleaned-master-files.png[Original master files overwritten by the first mod, title="Original master files overwritten by the first mod"]
. Just click on *Close* and we are good to go. Launch LOOT from MO to check our master files are not dirty anymore. As you can see, the warnings about filth in our master files have gone.
+
.Our master files are spotless now
image::DEFCON-01-LOOT-cleaned-master-files.png[Our master files are spotless now, title="Our master files are spotless now"]
. Close LOOT and let's head to the next step.

=== Tweaking the INI files

[NOTE]
====
Mods used in this chapter:

* http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/69787/[_BethINI_]
====

_Fallout 3_ has two INI configuration files located in `[$USERPROFILE\Documents\My Games\Fallout3]`:

* `FALLOUT.INI`
* `FalloutPrefs.ini`

These files are the core of the game, and adjusting an option there could mean the difference between a smooth playthrough and a CTD-plagued nightmare.

MO keeps a copy of these two files for each profile, therefore enabling different options for different profiles. Right now, there are two sets of these INI files, one for each profile, located in:

* `[$FO3_HOME\Mod Organizer\Profiles\DEFCON 00 (Vanilla)]`
* `[$FO3_HOME\Mod Organizer\Profiles\DEFCON 01 (Bug Fixes and Performance)]`

We are going to fix the default INI files using _BethINI_, and then create a new mod exclusively intended for tweaking certain options using MO. If you want to know how INI Tweaks work, take a look at the box titled "Some context on Ini Tweaks" in the http://wiki.step-project.com/Guide:Mod_Organizer[Official Mod Organizer Guide].

. Make sure MO is closed until further notice.
. Open the folder `[$USERPROFILE\Documents\My Games\Fallout3]` and create a backup of `FALLOUT.ini` and `FalloutPrefs.ini`.
. Download manually the [NexusFile]*BethINI* file from http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/69787/[_BethINI_]. You will get a file named `BethINI-69787-2-5.zip` or something like that, depending on the version you have downloaded.
. Unzip the file in a location of your choice. _BethINI_ is a portable program, so there is no need to install anything.
. Run `BethINI.exe`. The first thing you have to do is to select the game you are working with. BethINI handles a good bunch of Bethesda's games. Select _Fallout 3_, of course.
+
.Selecting the game in BethINI
image::DEFCON-01-BethINI-game-selection.png[Selecting the game in BethINI, title="Selecting the game in BethINI"]
. After a moment, the program opens in the *Basic* tab. However, switch to the *Setup* tab to do things in an orderly fashion.
+
.BethINI opens in the "Basic" tab by default
image::DEFCON-01-BethINI-default-Basic-tab.png[BethINI opens in the Basic tab by default, title="BethINI opens in the Basic tab by default"]
. In the *Setup* tab we are going to correct the path to MO and make sure the INI files won't be altered once finished with our tinkering. Select the path to MO in the third dropdown, starting from the top, and check *Make INIs Read-Only* option.
+
.Options in the "Setup" tab of BethINI
image::DEFCON-01-BethINI-Setup-tab.png[Options in the Setup tab of BethINI, title="Options in the Setup tab of BethINI"]
. Switch to the *Basic* tab and activate *Recommended Tweaks* and *Enable File Selection*. Change any other option regarding display or presets if you will.
+
.Options in the "Basic" tab of BethINI
image::DEFCON-01-BethINI-Basic-tab.png[Options in the Basic tab of BethINI, title="Options in the Basic tab of BethINI"]
. The remaining tabs need no modification, unless you have a lot of time to spare following the detailed http://www.tweakguides.com/Fallout3_1.html[Fallout 3 Tweaking Guide] (look who's talking, yeah). Just click on *Save and Exit* then.
. If you go back to the folder where the INI files are, you will find _three_ versions of each file:
* `Fallout.ini` and `FalloutPrefs.ini`: These are the versions modified by BethINI.
* `Fallout.ini.BethINIbackup` and `FalloutPrefs.ini.BethINIbackup`: These are the backup copies created by BethINI.
* Whichever name you gave them: These are the backup copies we made in the first step (redundant, just to be on the safe side).
. Open the folder `[$FO3_HOME\Mod Organizer\Profiles\DEFCON 01 (Bug Fixes and Performance)]` and create a backup of `fallout.ini` and `falloutprefs.ini` (the capitalization is a bit off, as you can see).
. Copy `Fallout.ini` and `FalloutPrefs.ini` from `[$USERPROFILE\Documents\My Games\Fallout3]` to `[$FO3_HOME\Mod Organizer\Profiles\DEFCON 01 (Bug Fixes and Performance)]`. Our DEFCON 01 profile now has the proper INI files. Every profile from now own will inherit its settings from the previous one, thus these files will spread accordingly.
. Open MO again. With the DEFCON 01 profile selected, click on the *Tools* button in the toolbar and then click on the *INI Editor* option.
+
.Launching the INI editor within Mod Organizer
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-launching-INI-editor.png[Launching the INI editor within MO, title="Launching the INI editor within MO"]
. The following window shows the INI editor within MO. The contents of each tab reflects the INI files regarding this specific profile, so any changes made here won't affect any other yet created profile. However, we are not going to change anything here, so close the window and move on.
+
.Mod Organizer INI editor
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-INI-editor.png[Mod Organizer INI editor, title="Mod Organizer INI editor"]
. From now on, any other change to the INI files will be performed through the INI Tweaks feature of MO. First, we need to create an empty folder named `[INI Tweaks]` within `[$FO3_HOME\Mod Organizer\overwrite]`.
. Back to MO, right-click in any empty area on the left pane and select *Refresh*.
+
.Refreshing the state of Mod Organizer
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-refreshing-MO-state.png[Refreshing the state of MO, title="Refreshing the state of MO"]

+
.Creating the _INI Tweaks_ mod
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-creating-INI-Tweaks-mod.png[Creating the INI Tweaks mod, title="Creating the INI Tweaks mod"]

+
.Naming the _INI Tweaks_ mod
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-INI-Tweaks-mod-name.png[Naming the INI Tweaks mod, title="Naming the INI Tweaks mod"]
. Oh, my, my! Look at that! Our plugins list is growing... At an excruciatingly slow pace, but no need to rush, really. You will notice a warning icon in the *Flags* column, but it's ok, because our mod is, in fact, completely empty.
+
._INI Tweaks_ mod newly created
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-INI-Tweaks-mod-created.png[INI Tweaks mod newly created, title="INI Tweaks mod newly created"]
. We are going to fill the mod with some tweaks suggested by Kelmych in his http://wiki.step-project.com/User:Kelmych/Fallout3_INIs[Fallout 3 INI Tweak Guide]. Double-click on the _INI Tweaks_ mod and switch to the *INI-Files* tab. Right-click on the *Ini Tweaks* panel and select *Create Tweak*.
+
.Option to create a tweak for our INI files

=== You don't want the Ink Spots to stutter, do you?

[NOTE]
====
Mods used in this chapter:

* http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/19122[_UPDATED Unofficial Fallout 3 Patch_]
====

If you have a [line-through]#potato# old computer, like me, you may think that the Ink Spots had https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l6vqPUM_FE[a severe case of stuttering when it comes to singing]. It may be caused by some old sound libraries the game was bundled with.

Nevertheless, that is easy to fix (don't get used to that, though).

. Open the `[$FO3_HOME]` folder.
. Create a backup copy of the following two files:
* `libvorbis.dll`
* `libvorbisfile.dll`
. Download the [NexusFile]*VorbisUpdate* file from http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/19122[_UPDATED Unofficial Fallout 3 Patch_].
. Unzip the file `VorbisUpdate-19122-1.zip` (or whatever its name is) in a location of your choice.
. Copy their namesakes from the unzipped file into `[$FO3_HOME]` folder.
. Copy the remaining DLL files into `[$FO3_HOME]`:
* `ogg.dll`
* `vorbis.dll`
* `vorbisenc.dll`

We are ready to begin with the serious shit. Stay tuned!

Now, this is the time! We are going to install our first mod through MO, so pay close attention to the steps involved.

. First, we are going to make sure MO is the preferred application to handle Nexus links protocol (NXM). Open the folder `[$FO3_HOME\Mod Organizer]`, run the program `nxmhandler.exe` and click on *Register active* (notice the "fallout3" entry; we created that when we associated MO with "Download with manager" links).
+
.Program to handle Nexus links
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-NXM-handler.png[Program to handle Nexus links, title="Program to handle Nexus links"]
. The NXM Handler will ask a strange question about being the primary handler registered. Just click on *Yes*.
+
.Confirming NXM Handler as the primary handler for Nexus Links
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-NXM-register-active.png[Confirming NXM Handler as the primary handler for Nexus Links, title="Confirming NXM Handler as the primary handler for Nexus Links"]
. Back to the NXM Handler main window, notice that the *Primary Handler* entry has changed to "<Current>". Click on *Close* and we are done registering the download protocol.
+
.NXM Handler registered as primary handler
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-NXM-primary-handler-registered.png[NXM Handler registered as primary handler, title="NXM Handler registered as primary handler"]
. Open MO, if you have not done it yet.
. Switch to the *Downloads* tab in the right pane. This tab should be empty, for we have not installed any mod yet.
+
.Empty *Downloads* tab
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-empty-Downloads-tab.png[Empty Downloads tab, title="Empty Downloads tab"]
. Open your web browser and navigate to the Nexus http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/19122[_UPDATED Unofficial Fallout 3 Patch_] page.
. Download the file [NexusFile]*Updated_Unofficial_Fallout3_Patch_Mod_Manager_Version* with the manager.
. Depending on how paranoid is your web browser (mine is Mozilla Firefox, and it's top of the line in this regard), you will be presented with a dialog to select the default application to open Nexus links, although we instructed MO to do so before. Mark *Remember my choice for nxm links*, keep `nxmhandler.exe` selected and click on *Open link*.
+
.Selecting the application to open NXM links
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-selecting-NXM-links-manager.png[Selecting the application to open NXM links, title="Selecting the application to open NXM links"]
. MO starts downloading the file we selected. It will take a while, for its size is over 190 MB.
+
.Mod Organizer downloading the unofficial patch
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-downloading-unofficial-patch.png[Mod Organizer downloading the unofficial patch, title="Mod Organizer downloading the unofficial patch"]
. Once the download is completed, double click on the entry with the mod name, as shown in the picture.
+
.Unofficial patch downloaded
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-unofficial-patch-downloaded.png[Unofficial patch downloaded, title="Unofficial patch downloaded"]
. MO tries to install the mod as quickly as possible by default, but it asks for permission first. We are *ALWAYS* going to install our mods manually, because although MO does a pretty good job figuring out the inner structure of any mod, sometimes it does some wild guesses which are not quite right. Leave the name unchanged and click on *Manual*.
+
.Selecting manual installation of the unofficial patch
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-Quick-Install-dialog.png[Selecting manual instalation of the unofficial patch, title="Selecting manual instalation of the unofficial patch"]
. The next window is one of the most important regarding to mod installation, and you will see it a fuckin' lot, so you'd better get used to it. This window allows us to change the inner structure of the mod to comply with the expected structure of any component under `[$FO3_HOME\Data]` folder. The structure of the unofficial patch is ok, so we don't have to change it (notice the "Looks good" message in the bottom left corner). However, the contents of the folder `[Readmes]` are not really necessary, so uncheck them, and finally click on *OK*.
+
.Adjusting the inner structure of the unofficial patch
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-unofficial-patch-structure.png[Adjusting the inner structure of the unofficial patch, title="Adjusting the inner structure of the unofficial patch"]
. MO starts decompressing the files into the virtual data folder. Remember: the files are not really being copied into the actual data folder. MO combines your whole mod stack to create a virtual data folder which _Fallout 3_ uses. Don't worry about that, though.
+
.Unofficial patch installation progress
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-unofficial-patch-installation-progress.png[Unofficial patch installation progress, title="Unofficial patch installation progress"]
. Once the installation finishes, the mod is marked as installed in the *Downloads* tab. We don't want aaaaaaaaaaaaaaall our installed mods to sit there until Doomsday, so put it out of the way by right-clicking on it and selecting *Remove from View* (be careful and don't delete the mod instead). In case you wanted to see your installed mods, mark the option *Show Hidden* at the bottom of the tab.
+
.Putting the unofficial patch out of the way
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-unofficial-patch-installation-finished.png[Putting the unofficial patch out of the way, title="Putting the unofficial patch out of the way"]
. Now, take a look at the left pane. You will see a new mod in your mod stack with the highest priority number (8), which means it will win any conflict as it will be loaded the last. Activate the mod with the checkbox at its left, and we're done!
+
.Unofficial patch activated
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-unofficial-patch-activated.png[Unofficial patch activated, title="Unofficial patch activated"]
. If you double-click on the mod name and switch to the *Conflicts* tab, you will see that the unofficial patch overwrites a great deal of files from the game and its DLCs, as it is intended. There's no need to verify the conflicts in every mod, but it won't hurt to check, just in case.
+
.Unofficial patch conflicts
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-unofficial-patch-conflicts.png[Unofficial patch conflicts, title="Unofficial patch conflicts"]
. The next steps involves LOOT, because we need to make sure our mods are loaded in the right order. MO places every new mod at the bottom of your load order by default, as you can see in the *Plugins* tab at the right pane.
+
.Unofficial patch placed at the bottom of the load order
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-unofficial-patch-bottom-load-order.png[Unofficial patch placed at the bottom of the load order, title="Unofficial patch placed at the bottom of the load order"]
. Run LOOT through the toolbar to sort our plugins.
+
.Running LOOT for the first time
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-running-LOOT-unofficial-patch.png[Running LOOT for the first time, title="Running LOOT for the first time"]
. LOOT dutifully informs us that we have not sorted our plugins yet, so click on the sorting icon (image:DEFCON-00-LOOT-sorting-icon.png[LOOT sorting icon, title="LOOT sorting icon"]).
+
.Sorting our load order with LOOT after installing the unofficial patch
image::DEFCON-01-LOOT-unofficial-patch.png[Sorting our load order with LOOT after installing the unofficial patch, title="Sorting our load order with LOOT after installing the unofficial patch"]
. LOOT does not actually make any changes to the load order, because the unofficial patch should be at the very bottom. I knew that (really, I knew it, I swear), but it is good for you to acquire good practices. Close LOOT when your feel of awe diminishes.
+
.The unofficial patch is already in the right place
image::DEFCON-01-LOOT-unofficial-patch-sorted.png[The unofficial patch is already in the right place, title="The unofficial patch is already in the right place"]
. You should test the game right now. Yes, for the first time! Yeah, I know that sensation, when you can hardly keep the shit inside your body and out of your pants. Trust me, I've been there myself. Go on, run the game through the *Run* button and start a new game. The game is now playable on Windows 7 or higher.

=== Where the fuck is the tilde key, anyway?

[NOTE]
====
Mods used in this chapter:

* http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/2637[_Console Key Binder_]
====

One of the things I have always considerer very annoying is the mapping of the console key in certain games. Fortunately, _Fallout 3_ is a game where the console key is welded to the key just to the left to the kbd:[1] key (or below the kbd:[Esc] key, if you please), so we say thank ya.

However, I prefer to have the console key assigned to a fixed key, present in every keyboard, no matter the language layout (for example, I have a Spanish keyboard). The mod we are about to install comes in handy. Nevertheless, bear in mind that the standard console key will not be removed, so you could still use it to fire up the console.

. Open MO.
. Using your web browser, download the file [NexusFile]*Console Key Binder* from http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/2637[_Console Key Binder_] clicking on the button *Download with manager*.
. Go back to MO and verify that the mod has been downloaded in the *Downloads* tab, right pane. Double-click on the mod to install it.
+
._Console Key Binder_ has been downloaded
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-Console-Key-Binder-downloaded.png[Console Key Binder has been downloaded, title="Console Key Binder has been downloaded"]
. In the *Quick Install* window, leave the name unchanged and select *Manual*, as usual.
+
.Manual installation of _Console Key Binder_
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-Quick-Install-Console-Key-Binder.png[Manual installation of Console Key Binder, title="Manual installation of Console Key Binder"]
. The mod's inner structure is pretty much fine, so we have just to unselect the `.html` file and click on *OK*. Remember to remove the installed mod from view when finished.
+
.Inner structure of _Console Key Binder_
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-Console-Key-Binder-structure.png[Inner structure of Console Key Binder, title="Inner structure of Console Key Binder"]

Launch the game (as usual, through MO and using FOSE), and fire up the console using the old key, to the left of the kbd:[1] key. When the console is activated, write the command `Set ConsoleKey to 87` and press kbd:[Enter]. You should get the response `set global >> 87`. Take into account that 87 is the decimal scancode of the kbd:[F11] key. There are http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/kbd/scancodes.html[a shitload of scancodes] you may use, but you should stick to http://cs.elderscrolls.com/index.php?title=HoldKey[the DirectX scancodes], just in case.

=== Crash Test Dummies will have a hard time here

[NOTE]
====
Mods used in this chapter:

* http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/53635/[_NVAC - New Vegas Anti Crash_]
====

_Fallout 3_ crashes.

A lot.

It's a Fact of Life you have to deal with, unless you are eager to fill the pockets of your therapist.

However, we can reduce the frequency _Fallout 3_ crashes by installing a little FOSE mod which takes care of unhandled exceptions which may ruin your day. Don't let the title fool you, because the mod serves both _Fallout 3_ and _Fallout New Vegas_.

. Open MO, as usual, and switch to the *Downloads* tab in the right pane.
. http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/53635/[_NVAC - New Vegas Anti Crash_] is a _Fallout New Vegas_ mod, so we cannot download it with MO, because MO has been instructed to handle _Fallout 3_ mod downloads. Download the file [NexusFile]*NVAC - New Vegas Anti Crash* manually instead, in a location of your choice.
. Download also the file [NexusFile]*DisableProcessWindowsGhosting v2*, in the *Optional files* section.
. Now, drag & drop the file `NVAC - New Vegas Anti Crash-53635-7-5-1-0.zip` (or whatever name it has) to the *Downloads* tab in MO's right pane (yes, you can do that).
+
.Sideloading NVAC in _Mod Organizer_
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-sideloading-NVAC.png[Sideloading NVAC in Mod Organizer, title="Sideloading NVAC in Mod Organizer"]
. Double-click on the mod entry in the *Downloads* tab to install it. The mod doesn't install anything in the data folder, so the installation is straightforward, without questions. Remove the installed mod from view in the *Downloads* tab.
. Activate the mod in the left pane, move it just below the unofficial patch, and we are good to go.
+
.NVAC plugin activated
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-NVAC-activated.png[NVAC plugin activated, title="NVAC plugin activated"]
+
[NOTE]
====
In prior versions of _Mod Organizer_ you should have had to rename the virtual folder where the plugin is deployed, from `[NVSE]` (_New Vegas Script Extender_) to `[FOSE]` (_Fallout Script Extender_). It seems in MO version 1.3.11 it's no longer necessary.
====
. Drag & drop the file `DisableProcessWindowsGhosting v2-53635-2.zip` to the *Downloads* tab in MO, like we did before.
+
.Sideloading DisableProcessWindowsGhosting in _Mod Organizer_
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-sideloading-DisableProcessWindowsGhosting.png[Sideloading DisableProcessWindowsGhosting in Mod Organizer, title="Sideloading DisableProcessWindowsGhosting in Mod Organizer"]
. Double-click on the mod entry in the *Downloads* tab. This time, the *Install Mods* window opens without asking for manual installation first, due to the fact that the mod contains a single file in its root. There is a bunch of things that need to be addressed.
* Notice the "No game data on top level" in red, in the bottom left corner.
* This file belongs to NVAC, so we don't want it to be installed in isolation. Rename the mod to "NVAC - New Vegas Anti Crash" in the upper right corner of the window to merge both mods.
* We need to create a valid structure first, so right-click on the `<data>` element and select *Create directory...*.
+

image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-DisableProcessWindowsGhosting-structure-1.png[Creating the first level directory for DisableProcessWindowsGhosting, title="Creating the first level directory for DisableProcessWindowsGhosting"]

.Second level folder for DisableProcessWindowsGhosting
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-DisableProcessWindowsGhosting-structure-4.png[Second level folder for DisableProcessWindowsGhosting, title="Second level folder for DisableProcessWindowsGhosting"]
. Now drag and drop the file `DisableProcessWindowsGhosting.dll` from its current place, under `[<data>]`, to `[Plugins]`. We have just virtually rearranged the contents of the mod to seamlessly deploy it into the game data folder. Click *OK* to finish.
+
.Place the DisableProcessWindowsGhosting file in the right folder
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-DisableProcessWindowsGhosting-structure-5.png[Place the DisableProcessWindowsGhosting file in the right folder, title="Place the DisableProcessWindowsGhosting file in the right folder"]

.Merging NVAC and DisableProcessWindowsGhosting
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-merging-NVAC-DisableProcessWindowsGhosting.png[Merging NVAC and DisableProcessWindowsGhosting, title="Merging NVAC and DisableProcessWindowsGhosting"]
. As usual, remove the mod from view in the *Downloads* pane.
. The mod "NVAC - New Vegas Anti Crash" remains in its place, in the left pane, apparently undisturbed. Double-click on it to bring up the properties window and navigate to the *Filetree* tab, where you can verify that the file `DisableProcessWindowsGhosting.dll` is in the right place, alongside `nvac.dll`. Click *Close* when you decide to stop staring at the window.
+
.NVAC and DisableProcessWindowsGhosting merged
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-NVAC-DisableProcessWindowsGhosting-merged.png[NVAC and DisableProcessWindowsGhosting merged, title="NVAC and DisableProcessWindowsGhosting merged"]

=== Fake full-screen mode

[NOTE]

Mods used in this chapter:

* http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/21337/[_OneTweak for FO3_]
====

Bethesda's games have a tendency towards crashing when run in full-screen mode, as awkward as it sounds. Thus, the advantage in using what is called windowed borderless mode, or fake full-screen, which allows you to kbd:[Alt] + kbd:[Tab] your way out of the game anytime you wish, as well as increasing stability. The FOSE plugin we are about to install serves that purpose.

. Open MO and switch to the *Downloads* tab in the right pane.
. Download with the manager the file [NexusFile]*OneTweak for Fallout 3* from http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/21337/[_OneTweak for FO3_].

=== Saving games the right way

[NOTE]
====
Mods used in this chapter:

* http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/3729/[_CASM_]
====

Let me tell you a story.

I was once, in my faraway youth, playing the incredible _Tomb Raider_, and I mean the *original* _Tomb Raider_, with polygons like daggers (no pun intended).

.Yeah, she was Lara Croft, believe it or not
image::DEFCON-01-Original-Lara-Croft.png[Yeah, she was Lara Croft, believe it or not, title="Yeah, she was Lara Croft, believe it or not"]

I was climbing a cliff, facing the vertical slope, when I heard an ominous sound.

____
FLAP! FLAP!
____

"FLAP!? FLAP!?", I though. I didn't recognize the sound, but as you learned quickly in the game, almost anything would kill you. So, I turned around just to see a flying gargoyle hovering inches from me, right in front of my highly polygonal face.

I panicked.

I smashed the keyboard to... Well, I don't know what I was trying to do, honestly. The next I know is that I was falling down the cliff.

But I was a cautious player, and I had one of my fingers virtually soldered to the kbd:[F5] key to quicksave the game at every step of the road.

So, I hit the quickload key to get back to the cliffside and face the gargoyle, or so I thought, because I hit the *quicksave* key by mistake. In the middle of a fatal falling.

When I realized what I had done, I screamed in pain, echoing Lara's screams while she was falling, for *I had no other saved games* (and you had to manually copy the files from time to time; there was no named savegames at the time, as far as I remember).

I completely fucked up my playthrough, and I had been playing a good deal of hours by then.

And you wonder, how could this moron hit the quicksave key instead of the quickload key? They are far apart from each other, aren't they?

*NO, THEY WEREN'T.*

I would like to know the genius who thought that putting the quicksave key bound to kbd:[F5] and the quickload key bound to kbd:[F6] was a good idea. I ended hitting kbd:[F5] by accident, instead of kbd:[F6].

The story had a happy ending, though, because my brother, who was also playing the game, gave me his own saved game, not far from the cliff I were, and not before making a savage mockery of my poor self.

However, these are the morals of the story.

* Never, *NEVER* bind your quickload and quicksave keys too close from each other.
* Never, *NEVER* rely exclusively on quicksaved games as a sort of failsafe net.
* Use profusely named saved games. Don't be shy. Save a lot, and create meaningful saved games.

Back to _Fallout 3_, as you can imagine, saved games will prevent your life to become a miserable pile of shit when the game suddenly decides it is a good idea to crash its way out to desktop (and it *WILL* happen, trust me). However, as you can also imagine, the standard saving mechanics in _Fallout 3_ are a complete and utter crap.

The mod we are about to install, CASM (which stands for "Cipscis' Automatic Save Manager"), is a fine piece of work which:

* Assigns the kbd:[F4] key to quicksave and the kbd:[F8] key to quick save, using *named* saves.
* Saves the game automatically with a given frequency.
* Saves the game automatically under certain events.

Let's go, then.

. Open MO and switch to the *Downloads* tab in the right pane (that should go without saying).
. Download the file [NexusFile]*CASM_v1_2_3* with manager from http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/3729/[_CASM_] page.
+
.CASM is ready to be installed
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-CASM-ready-to-be-installed.png[CASM is ready to be installed, title="CASM is ready to be installed"]
. Double-click on the mod entry in the *Downloads* tab to bring up the *Quick Install* window. Click on *Manual*, as usual.
+
.Quick Install window for CASM
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-CASM-Quick-Install.png[Quick Install window for CASM, title="Quick Install window for CASM"]
. The inner structure of CASM is ok right off the bat, so we don't need to rearrange anything. Just click on *OK*.
+
.The inner structure of CASM looks pretty good
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-CASM-structure-ok.png[The inner structure of CASM looks pretty good, title="The inner structure of CASM looks pretty good"]
. Back to the MO main window, you can see that CASM is installed but not active in the left pane. We need to correct the version number and create an INI tweak, so double-click on the mod entry.
+
.CASM is installed but not active yet
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-CASM-not-active-yet.png[CASM is installed but not active yet, title="CASM is installed but not active yet"]
. First, we are going to correct the version number in the *Nexus Info* tab of the properties window we have just brought up. Write the corresponding version (1.2.3, as of this writing).
+
.CASM corrected version number
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-CASM-corrected-version-number.png[CASM corrected version number, title="CASM corrected version number"]
. Next, switch to the *INI-Files* tab, where we are going to create an INI tweak to disable the standard savegame mechanics to avoid meddling with CASM own mechanics. Right click on the *Ini Tweaks* pane and select the option *Create Tweak*.
+
.Creating an INI tweak in CASM
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-CASM-creating-INI-tweak.png[Creating an INI tweak in CASM, title="Creating an INI tweak in CASM"]
. The INI tweak will be named "DisableDefaultSaving", although you can use any name you want. Click on *OK* when you have written a thoughtful name.
+
.Naming the INI tweak in CASM
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-CASM-naming-INI-tweak.png[Naming the INI tweak in CASM, title="Naming the INI tweak in CASM"]

+
.CASM is installed and ready to be used
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-CASM-installed-and-ready.png[CASM is installed and ready to be used, title="CASM is installed and ready to be used"]
. Take a look at the contents of the *Plugins* tab in the right pane. You can see that there is a file named `CASM.esp` sitting at the bottom of your load order. Every time a new `.esp` or `.esm` file is added to your load order, you need to run LOOT to make sure the file is in its right place.
+
.CASM plugin sitting at the bottom of your load order
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-CASM-plugin.png[CASM plugin sitting at the bottom of your load order, title="CASM plugin sitting at the bottom of your load order"]
. Run LOOT through the toolbar icon and sort your load order. No changes will be made, but this is a habit you need to develop, so humor me.
+
.CASM doesn't move a bit in the load order
image::DEFCON-01-LOOT-CASM-load-order.png[CASM doesn't move a bit in the load order, title="CASM doesn't move a bit in the load order"]
. Close LOOT and run the game. In the main menu screen, select *Settings* and then *Gameplay* to verify that the three default saving options are disabled.
+
._Fallout 3_ default saving options disabled
image::DEFCON-01-Fallout-3-default-saving-disabled.png[Fallout 3 default saving options disabled, title="Fallout 3 default saving options disabled"]
. CASM is fully configurable through an in-game option, using your Pip-Boy 3000 (don't worry if you don't know what the heck a Pip-Boy is yet). While in-game, press the kbd:[Tab] key to bring up your Pip-Boy, and then navigate to the *Items* button, *Aid* section. You will see an "item" called *CASM options menu*.
+
.CASM in-game menu through your Pip-Boy
image::DEFCON-01-Fallout-3-CASM-in-game-menu.png[CASM in-game menu through your Pip-Boy, title="CASM in-game menu through your Pip-Boy"]
. Select the *Casm options menu* "item" and then bring down your Pip-Boy by pressing the kbd:[Tab] key (yeah, sort of counter-intuitive). An overlaid menu will appear with a lot of options for you to configure, although they are pretty self-explanatory.
+
.CASM in-game settings
image::DEFCON-01-Fallout-3-CASM-in-game-settings.png[CASM in-game settings, title="CASM in-game settings"]

And this is it! Another piece fits in our structure.

[WARNING]
====
Remember! You need to change the default console key used by http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/2637[_Console Key Binder_] from kbd:[F4] to something else, like kbd:[F11], as I explained before, in order to avoid collision with the default quicksave key in CASM.

=== Getting rid of stutter

[NOTE]
====
Mods used in this chapter:

* http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/8886/[_Fallout Stutter Remover_]
====

Imagine you are playing _Fallout 3_ with your shiny new PC, burning CPU cycles like you were Donald Trump in one of his Twitter outburst sprees, and all of a sudden, something bothers you, sending chills to the bone. You don't quite know where this sensation comes from, but you are sure that something is off with your game.

Let me give it a name for you: micro-stutters. Getting right to the point, micro-stutters are little jumps perceived in the camera movement, specially when you are strafing, no matter how fluid is your game in any other regard.

[TIP]
====
Gopher explains the nature of micro-stuttering in a https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tONiXNbwSt0[good video about the game performance], and Cal from DirtyWeasel shows us https://youtu.be/T_hJY9vaN7A?t=20m40s[how to install _Fallout Stutter Remover_ using MO] to get rid of these little annoyances.
====

Let's fix that, right now.

. Open MO and switch to the *Downloads* tab in the right pane, as usual.
. Download the file [NexusFile]*FSR_4-1-36* with manager from the http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/8886/[_Fallout Stutter Remover_] page.
+
.Fallout Stutter Remover is ready to be installed
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-FSR-ready-to-be-installed.png[Fallout Stutter Remover is ready to be installed, title="Fallout Stutter Remover is ready to be installed"]
. Double-click on the mod entry in the *Downloads* tab to bring up the *Install* window. The inner structure of the mod is not quite good, so no automatic install is offered, going for full manual installation instead. There are two folders on the top level, `[Data]` and `[src]`, being of interest only the former. Right-click on it and select *Set data directory* to make that folder the root of our data hierarchy.
+
.Adjusting the data folder for FSR
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-FSR-adjusting-data-folder.png[Adjusting the data folder for FSR, title="Adjusting the data folder for FSR"]

+
.FSR inner structure adjusted
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-FSR-data-folder-adjusted.png[FSR inner structure adjusted, title="FSR inner structure adjusted"]
. FSR sits on the bottom in the left pane, as it should be. We need to tinker a little with the mod configuration before activating it, so double-click on its name.
+
.FSR is installed but not ready yet
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-FSR-installed-but-not-active.png[FSR is installed but not ready yet, title="FSR is installed but not ready yet"]
. The mod properties window should open in the *INI-Files* tab (if not, switch to it). In the left pane, click on the only item in the *Ini Files* box (`FOSE/Plugins/sr_Fallout_Stutter_Remover.ini`) to see its contents in the right pane.
+
.FSR configuration file
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-FSR-configuration-file.png[FSR configuration file, title="FSR configuration file"]
. Kelmych lends us a hand in his guide to show http://wiki.step-project.com/User:Kelmych/Fallout3#Fallout_Stutter_Remover[the proper configuration we need]. We only need to modify the `FPS_Management` section (the third one in the `.ini` file), as follows.
+
----
FPS_Management = {
    bInject_iFPSClamp = 1
    fMaximumFPS = 60
    fMinimumFPS = 30
    iFPS_Report_Period = 4000
    fExtraSleepPercent = 0.05
}
----
. With the contents modified, just click on *Save* and then *Close*.
+
.FSR modified configuration file
image::DEFCON-01-Mod-Organizer-FSR-modified-configuration.png[FSR modified configuration file, title="FSR modified configuration file"]
. Finally, activate the mod in the left pane and we are good to go. This is a FOSE-only mod, so there's no need to rearrange the load order. Launch the game and strafe your way around for a while to see for yourself the smoothness the game has acquired.

We are going to install several completely unrelated mods which I found... Well, I don't quite remember how, or why I cherry-picked them. They are not going to introduce huge changes in-game, so that we can still consider the game as Vanilla, at least content-wise.

These are the fixes each mod introduces:

* _Intro Street Bus and Dupont Alignment_: This mod adds the bus seen in the intro movie to the landscape of Washington D.C., giving a nice and lore-friendly touch to the game. Besides, it corrects some alignment mismatch in the area surrounding the GNR Radio building.
* _Rivet City Realignment_: This is one of these things that you wouldn't notice in your life, but once you read about that, you cannot help noticing it over and over again. Rivet City interiors don't match the outer architecture of the city, so this mod fixes that.
* _Scribe Yearling takes all Pre-War Books_: This is a small mod which enables an NPC called Scribe Yearlings to buy certain type of pre-war books you will likely have in large amounts.
* _NPC-Confessor Cromwell has a Break EV _ DV_: This mod adds a daily routine to an NPC called Confessor Cromwell, which you will likely encounter early in the game, for he is giving a neverending speech in Megaton (unless you install this mod, this is).
* _MTC BigTownMissingRobots Fix_: This mod fixes a bug where certain robots are missing from a junkyard in Big Town, preventing you from finishing a secondary quest

Without further ado, let's get to it.

Honestly, neither do I. I just made it up. Anyway, launch LOOT and hit the *Sort Plugins* button. There shouldn't be any changes to the load order, though. Close LOOT to finish with the installation of the unrelated fixes.

Let's say you have a mild case of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, and let's say that, more often than not, "mild" is a complete understatement to describe what rushes through your blood when you enter a new place in-game and you see a zillion of small pickable objects you just *NEED* to have, whatever reason you make up for it.

I have just described what I feel with this kind of games. I need to loot everything, or, at least, everything I can without stealing, unless I want my character to be a real son of a bitch (which I don't; I am a kind hearted person, after all).

The problem is that small, lootable objects in _Fallout 3_ tend to have a weird behavior regarding their position or, to be precise, their stacking. Every object has a collision mesh to establish its limits, so that when two objects collide, the game uses their collision meshes to avoid the dreaded clipping effect, and the standard collision meshes tend to extend themselves _outside_ the objects they contain.

This is the reason why you cannot neatly stack objects you have snatched without gaps between them.

.Look, ma, I'm floating!
image::DEFCON-01-Fallout-3-default-collision-meshes.png[Look, ma, I'm floating!, title="Look, ma, I'm floating!"]

The two mods we are going to install address this problem, altering the collision meshes of a lot of objects. http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/15704/[_Detailed Collisions_] fixes ordinary objects, while http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/19949/[_Precision Collision - Clutter_] fixes small, cluttering objects.

The Capital Wasteland in _Fallout 3_ is a dark and dirty place, and rightly so, but the developers might have been a little too enthusiastic spreading dirt all around the game.

=== Adopt an useless rock today!

====

_Fallout 3_ developers show their love for the details in every corner of the game.

In a slightly manic way.

The game engine is not rock solid, to begin with (no pun intended, I swear), but when it comes to handle zillions of useless objects for the sake of just showing you have zillions of rocks around you... Well, *NO*.

There is a mod which does something seemingly very simple: removing all unused objects from the game, improving performance. This mod is called http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/13520/[_Better Game Performance_].

Let's install this mod.

=== Punxsutawney Phil is not alive anymore

One of the most annoying things I have to suffer every time I start a new playthrough is the introductory part of the game, in Vault 101.

The introductory chapter has its charm the first time you play it, and even the second time, if you ask me. But from the second time onwards, it gets as close as could be to a post-apocalyptic version of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day_(film)[Groundhog Day].

If you follow this guide long enough to install _Fallout Wanderers Edition_ (why shouldn't you?), you will have several different alternate starts for your character, but I have never liked them. I _like_ to be the lone wanderer, abruptly egressed from the dictatorial confinement of Vault 101. What I _don't like_ is repeating all the initial steps over and over again each time I want to start a new game.

If you are worried about this, like me, fear not! I am offering you the perfect groundhog killer: link:saves/FO3-before-leaving-vault-101.zip[a saved game right before leaving Vault 101]. This game has been saved after installing the mods in the <<DEFCON 01 (Bug Fixes and Performance), DEFCON 01 chapter>>.

.The Lone Wanderer right before leaving Vault 101
image::DEFCON-01-Fallout-3-Lone-Wanderer-before-leaving-Vault-101.png[The Lone Wanderer right before leaving Vault 101, title="The Lone Wanderer right before leaving Vault 101"]

When you open the door to the Wasteland, a menu will appear, offering you the possibility to change every aspect of your character: name, race, gender, S.P.E.C.I.A.L. attributes and skills, so you can customize the Generic Hero included in the saved game to fit your needs and dark desires.

.Changing the Lone Wanderer stats and info before leaving Vault 101
image::DEFCON-01-Fallout-3-changing-Lone-Wanderer-before-leaving-Vault-101.png[Changing the Lone Wanderer stats and info before leaving Vault 101, title="Changing the Lone Wanderer stats and info before leaving Vault 101"]

If you want to use the saved game, just copy the file `FO3-before-leaving-vault-101.zip` to the folder `[%USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Games\Fallout3\Saves]` and unzip it, removing the ZIP file after. Then just run the game and load the saved game, which should run fine as long as you have the mods in this chapter installed.

=== Patching the shit out of the game

We could say that things are pretty much under control, for now. We have installed a bunch of mods, sure, but the game itself remains essentially the same.

However, this is the point where we are going to introduce two concepts that will accompany us from now on: merged and bashed patches. These are special mods to ensure that no compatibility problems among the installed mods will arise. Take into account that even with Bethesda’s main files, there are inconsistencies across the different DLCs, let alone with a fuckload of mods installed, each one with its own set of items and rules.

Before explaining how to install them, you should know that there will be a pair of patches for you to install at the end of each major DEFCON chapter. Nevertheless, you only need to install them in the last DEFCON chapter you decide to follow.

Repeating myself, you don't need to follow through the entire guide. You could choose to follow it through to, say, <<DEFCON 11 (Lighting), the chapter about lighting>>, discarding the rest. In that case, you only need to install a merged and a bashed patch at the end of that chapter. Likewise, if you decide to stop here, you should install the patches at this point and forget the rest of the guide.

In other words, you only need to install a merged and a bashed patch in the last DEFCON chapter you decide to follow.

Creating a merged patch is a no-brainer, but creating a bashed patch is like going to swim at sea everyday uttering the name of the Great Cthulhu before the water licks your balls.

That's a recipe for disaster, hear me well.

This is why I will provide a merged and a bashed patch at the end of each major DEFCON chapter. As I said, ignore them until the last DEFCON chapter you decide to follow.

However, if you feel suicidal or, at some point, you decide not to follow this guide to the letter (why should you?), you have two appendices, one explaining <<Appendix 1: How to create your own merged patch, how to create a merged patch>> and the other explaining <<Appendix 2: How to create your own bashed patch, how to create a bashed patch>>.

If you want to stop right here, in the DEFCON 01 profile (although I heartedly recommend following through at least to the next chapter, about <<DEFCON 02 (User Interface), user interface>>), go ahead and <<DEFCON 01 Merged Patch, install the provided merged patch>> (and then, <<DEFCON 01 Bashed Patch, install the provided bashed patch>>). Otherwise, jump to the <<DEFCON 02 (User Interface), next DEFCON chapter>>.




==== DEFCON 01 Merged Patch

The merged patches I will provide are fine-tuned to correct any inconsistencies that the creation process may have introduced. However, remember that you need to have every mod in this DEFCON chapter installed for it to work properly.

Let's install the patch, then.

. Open MO and switch to the *Downloads* tab in the right pane.
. Download the pre-generated patch link:patches/DEFCON-01-Merged-Patch-1.0.zip[DEFCON 01 Merged Patch] in a location of your choice.
. Drag and drop the file from the folder you put it into to the *Downloads* tab in the right pane of MO.

==== DEFCON 01 Bashed Patch

Like merged patches, a bashed patch needs every mod I mention in the corresponding chapter installed (in the right order, besides). A bashed patch also aims at inconsistencies in the particular mix of your mod stack, adding certain advanced tweaks which are not present in merged patches.

Installing the bashed patch is very much like we did with the merged patch. Sometimes, copy-and-paste is the right way to go.

. Open MO and switch to the *Downloads* tab in the right pane.
. Download the pre-generated patch link:patches/DEFCON-01-Bashed-Patch-1.0.zip[DEFCON 01 Bashed Patch] in a location of your choice.
. Drag and drop the file from the folder you put it into to the *Downloads* tab in the right pane of MO.

=== Chapter recap

After installing all these mods and patches, what do we have?

At this point, we have a version of _Fallout 3 Game of the Year Edition_ which is mostly Vanilla, at least content, graphics and mechanics-wise. We have applied a bunch of fixes, ensuring that the game will run smoothly in modern systems, reducing the probability of a CTD to a minimum.

You can stop here, skipping the rest of the guide, and start playing the game. There is nothing reprehensible about that. However, I would like you to stay for a little while, at least until the end of the <<DEFCON 02 (User Interface), user interface chapter>>. The game will still be the same regarding to its contents, graphics and mechanics, but we are going to get rid of the ugly user interface, making for a much better experience.




////
	DEFCON 02 (User Interface) chapter.
////

== DEFCON 02 (User Interface)

_Fallout 3_ has a way of reminding you that, no matter how hard you want to get yourself into the game, it's still a game. I mean, yeah, the game needs a HUD (Heads-Up Display), but, does it need to be so fucking huge and obstrusive?

This is an immersion-breaker for me. I like clean user interfaces that doesn't get in your way, allowing me to enjoy the in-game world without having it constantly pointing out where my enemies are, how much health do I have until being gang raped by a bunch of super-mutants or how much ammunition I may spend in a frenzied assault.

Sure, this is a matter of personal taste, but I am the kind of person who always tries to play games in the hardest possible difficulty. Maybe I have an Spartan streak.

In this chapter we are going to install a few mods that will allow you to customize your user interface, improving the overall look of the HUD and the in-game menus.




=== Creating the profile

The first thing we are going to do in each major chapter is to create a new profile on top of the previous one. The steps are pretty much the same that we saw in <<Creating the profile, the DEFCON 01 chapter>>, although with a subtle difference: we need to disable the merged and bashed patches we created in the preceding chapter. Failing in doing so would result in [line-through]#quantum anomalies# CTDs all over the place.

. Launch MO.
. Click on the MO profiles button.
+
.Mod Organizer profiles button
image::DEFCON-02-Mod-Organizer-profiles-button.png[Mod Organizer profiles button, title="Mod Organizer profiles button"]
. In the profiles management window, select the *DEFCON 01 (Bug Fixes and Performance)* profile and click on *Copy*.

image::DEFCON-02-Mod-Organizer-copying-DEFCON-01-profile.png[Copying DEFCON 01 profile in Mod Organizer, title="Copying DEFCON 01 profile in Mod Organizer"]
. In the following window, write "DEFCON 02 (User Interface)" as the profile name and click *OK*.
+
.Naming DEFCON 02 profile in Mod Organizer
image::DEFCON-02-Mod-Organizer-naming-profile.png[Naming DEFCON 02 profile in Mod Organizer, title="Naming DEFCON 02 profile in Mod Organizer"]

+
.DEFCON 02 profile has been created
image::DEFCON-02-Mod-Organizer-profile-created.png[DEFCON 02 profile has been created, title="DEFCON 02 profile has been created"]

+
.Selecting the DEFCON 02 profile

+
.DEFCON 02 profile selected
image::DEFCON-02-Mod-Organizer-profile-selected.png[DEFCON 02 profile selected, title="DEFCON 02 profile selected"]

=== Cooperate, or else!

[NOTE]
====
Mods used in this chapter:

* http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/20867/[_UIO - User Interface Organizer_]
====

We installed a good bunch of mods in the <<DEFCON 01 (Bug Fixes and Performance), first meaningful chapter>>, and we learned that we need to be careful about the load order, meaning the plugins (`.esp` files) should be carefully arranged to avoid conflicts. We also learned that the "install" order (which I prefer to think of as "stacking" order) is important too, although not so critical, except in certain cases.

The first part of the assertion will remain constant throughout the guide. The second part will no longer applies when it comes to user interface mods.

Ok, this is going to be a bit technical, but try to bear with me. From this point on, user interface mods should be carefully stacked, because they write the same HUD files. There is a special file called `hud_main_menu.xml` that is present in the most important mods of this guide, so we need to pay special attention to the way the mods stack on top of another, in MO's left pane (remember: the lower a mod is in the left pane, the higher its priority is; it's kind of an "inverted" stack).

However, it won't be enough to stack the mods in a particular order. We need them to _cooperate_, adding their quirks to the HUD without deleting the specifics of any mod lower in the stack (with a lower priority index, that is). For example, you don't want a mod which adds a HUD movement detector to erase the grenade indicator added by another mod.

This is where http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/20867/[_User Interface Organizer_], or _UIO_, for short, comes. It is a FOSE plugin which ensures that all HUD-related plugins play along nicely, detecting and resolving conflicts on the fly.

[WARNING]
====
UIO has to be the highest priority installed mod with regard to user interface mods, which means it should be the the last in the left pane, only higher than compatibility patches.

Cal, from Dirty Weasel has a good video about https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLWMvEg2LxwXbtc-mZT_H9pOwhIdOcMcn9&v=9ilscW_GJ5I[installing user interface related mods] (43:25), although he is focused on https://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1077483-wipzbeta-darnified-ui-f3/[DarnUI], which we will install in the <<Face-washing the HUD, next chapter>>. We are also going to use Kelmych's guide to set the http://wiki.step-project.com/User:Kelmych/Fallout3#The_Need_for_UIO_-_User_Interface_Organizer[correct stacking order for user interface mods].
====

. Open MO and switch to the *Downloads* tab in the right pane.
. Download [NexusFile]*UIO - User Interface Organizer* file from http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/20867/[_UIO - User Interface Organizer_] with the manager.
+
.UIO is downloaded and ready to be installed
image::DEFCON-02-Mod-Organizer-UIO-downloaded-and-ready.png[UIO is downloaded and ready to be installed, title="UIO is downloaded and ready to be installed"]
. Double-click on the mod to run the external installer. No Quick Install window here.
+
.External installer for UIO
image::DEFCON-02-Mod-Organizer-UIO-external-installer.png[External installer for UIO, title="External installer for UIO"]
. UIO is silently installed at the bottom of the left pane. Move it above the two disabled DEFCON 01 patches and activate it.
+
.UIO installed, relocated and active
image::DEFCON-02-Mod-Organizer-UIO-installed-relocated-and-active.png[UIO installed, relocated and active, title="UIO installed, relocated and active"]
. You may run the game now, although there will be no noticeable differences. However, there is a thing you need to take into account: we have disabled the merged and bashed patches, so when we try to load a game which was saved with these patches active, _Fallout 3_ warns that there may be missing content. Don't worry about that, because we are going to add new patches at the end of this chapter.
+
.'Fallout 3' gives us fair warning about the missing patches
image::DEFCON-02-Fallout-3-loading-saved-game-with-disabled-patches.png['Fallout 3' gives us fair warning about the missing patches, title="'Fallout 3' gives us fair warning about the missing patches"]
. Back to MO, you may notice that the warning sign in the toolbar is highlighted (you don't need a screenshot at this point, do you?). UIO creates files and folders in the overwrite mod to regenerate certain user interface files. Double-click on the overwrite special mod in the left pane to inspect them.
+
.Empty folders created by UIO in the overwrite mod
image::DEFCON-02-Mod-Organizer-UIO-empty-folders-in-overwrite-mod.png[Empty folders created by UIO in the overwrite mod, title="Empty folders created by UIO in the overwrite mod"]
. You can see that there are no files, because we have not installed any user interface related mod yet. However, let's drag and drop the `[uio]` folder to the UIO entry in the left pane to get things ready.
+
.Drag and drop the UIO generated files to the mod entry
image::DEFCON-02-Mod-Organizer-UIO-drag-and-drop-generated-files.png[Drag and drop the UIO generated files to the mod entry, title="Drag and drop the UIO generated files to the mod entry"]
. Double-click on the UIO entry in the left pane to show the properties window and navigate to the *Filetree* tab to check on the mod contents.
+
.UIO generated files are in place now
image::DEFCON-02-Mod-Organizer-UIO-generated-files-in-place.png[UIO generated files are in place now, title="UIO generated files are in place now"]

We have just prepared our game to use several user interface mods without a hitch. Things are going to get interesting in the next chapters. Stay tuned!

Mods used in this chapter:

_Fallout 3_ has a problem regarding its user interface: its huge. I think it has to do with using the same interface in the XBox and PC versions, not taking advantage of the PC capabilities.

https://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1077483-wipzbeta-darnified-ui-f3/[_DarNified UI F3_] comes to the rescue, shrinking the interface to acceptable levels, and giving us more screen real-estate to play with, which is very noticeable using the Pip-Boy, for example.

Gopher has a video about https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqCzCXEydwU[user interface mods] (25:05) which, although is aimed to Nexus Mod Manager users, it is useful to have a glimpse of the different in-game options of DarNified UI (from minute 7:00).

====

_Fallout 3_ has a good deal of shoot-outs, where you'd better be packing solid iron to wipe out your enemies. However, you will be as good as fuck if you rely on the default aiming capabilities of the game, including the crosshair. We'll be addressing the ironsights later in chapter <<DEFCON 06 (New and Improved Weapons), DEFCON 06>>, but now is the moment to improve your chances of survival by improving the way you know where you are aiming to.

We are going to install two mods for this. https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/15724/[_Dynamic Crosshair_] resizes the crosshair to show the actual spreading area of the weapon (e.g., a sawed-off shotgun has a much larger spread that a 9 mm handgun). https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/240/[_Smaller Crosshair_] replaces the default crosshair with a small crosshair of our choice.

Let's begin with this.

. Open MO and switch to the *Downloads* tab in the right pane.
. Download the file [NexusFile]*Dynamic Crosshair - Darnified UI* from https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/15724/[_Dynamic Crosshair_] with the manager.
+
.Dynamic Crosshair is downloaded and ready to be installed
image::DEFCON-02-Mod-Organizer-Dynamic-Crosshair-downloaded-and-ready.png[Dynamic Crosshair is downloaded and ready to be installed, title="Dynamic Crosshair is downloaded and ready to be installed"]
. Double-click on the mod to show the Quick Install window, where you should change nothing. Just click on *Manual*.
+
.Dynamic Crosshair Quick Install window
image::DEFCON-02-Mod-Organizer-Dynamic-Crosshair-Quick-Install-window.png[Dynamic Crosshair Quick Install window, title="Dynamic Crosshair Quick Install window"]
. The inner structure of the mod is correct, so just click on *OK*.
+
.Dynamic Crosshair inner structure
image::DEFCON-02-Mod-Organizer-Dynamic-Crosshair-inner-structure.png[Dynamic Crosshair inner structure, title="Dynamic Crosshair inner structure"]
. Move the mod entry in the left pane just above _UIO_ and activate it. Notice the plugin `DynamicCrosshair.esp` at the bottom of your load order. There is no need to run LOOT, because the load order is good already.
+
.Dynamic Crosshair installed and active
image::DEFCON-02-Mod-Organizer-Dynamic-Crosshair-installed-and-active.png[Dynamic Crosshair installed and active, title="Dynamic Crosshair installed and active"]
. It's time to shrink the size of the default crosshair, and we need to choose the crosshair that best fits your needs. There are four flavours: classic, larger dot, single pixel and small dot. I am going to choose [NexusFile]*Larger dot crosshair* from https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/240/[_Smaller Crosshair_], but feel free to download the one you fancy most:

.Smaller Crosshair is installed but not active yet
image::DEFCON-02-Mod-Organizer-Smaller-Crosshair-installed-but-not-active-yet.png[Smaller Crosshair is installed but not active yet, title="Smaller Crosshair is installed but not active yet"]

+
.Smaller Crosshair corrected version number
image::DEFCON-02-Mod-Organizer-Smaller-Crosshair-correcting-version-number.png[Smaller Crosshair corrected version number, title="Smaller Crosshair corrected version number"]

== Appendix 1: How to create your own merged patch

If you have a lot of time to spare, you feel somewhat masochist or you are giving me a big middle finger while you decide that you will install pretty much the fucking mods you like, you need to create your own merged patch.

[TIP]
====
Gopher has a video (39:12) in which he explains https://youtu.be/uPK7R71zcwM?t=14m5s[what is a merged patch and why we should use it]. Cal, from Dirty Weasel, also has a video (32:06) explaining https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLWMvEg2LxwXYgN9UIEFAEGxfmT5ondfIi&v=v3tPQKDStTc[how to create merged and bashed patches for _Fallout New Vegas_], although the process is very similar in _Fallout 3_.
====

Take into account that a merged patch is not a magic fix. There could be little inconsistencies across all the plugins used to create the merged patch, inconsistencies you should address one by one, at least hypothetically. That is not the case with the provided merged patches at the end of each major DEFCON chapter, which are shiny, polished and full of glamour!

The process to create a merged patch is pretty straightforward.

. Open MO in your desired profile.
. Disable any merged or bashed patch you have previously created. This is very important because merged and bashed patches are not cumulative. You have to create a new one for each profile where applicable.
+
.Disabling previous merged and bashed patches
image::Appendix-1-Mod-Organizer-disabling-patches.png[Disabling previous merged and bashed patches, title="Disabling previous merged and bashed patches"]
. Launch xEdit using the toolbar button which creation is lost in the mists of time.
+
.Launching xEdit through the toolbar button
image::Appendix-1-Mod-Organizer-xEdit-toolbar-button.png[Launching xEdit through the toolbar button, title="Launching xEdit through the toolbar button"]
. Select all the files in your load order, **except any merged or bashed patch** (you should have disabled them first, anyway).
+
.Selecting all the plugins to create a merged patch
image::Appendix-1-xEdit-selecting-all-files-to-create-merged-patch.png[Selecting all the plugins to create a merged patch, title="Selecting all the plugins to create a merged patch"]
. xEdit takes its time to load all the plugins, so you'd better go and fix yourself a strong-spirited beverage in the meantime. Look for a message in the right pane which says "Background Loader: finished" to know when to stop fixing yourself drinks.
+
.xEdit has loaded all your plugins
image::Appendix-1-xEdit-finished-loading-all-plugins.png[xEdit has loaded all your plugins, title="xEdit has loaded all your plugins"]
. Right-click anywhere in the left pane and select *Other* &rarr; *Create Merged Patch*.
+
.Option to create a merged patch in xEdit
image::Appendix-1-xEdit-create-merged-patch-option.png[Option to create a merged patch in xEdit, title="Option to create a merged patch in xEdit"]
. xEdit shows a window in which you can give a name to your merged patch. I'd recommend using the name of the DEFCON profile you are generating the patch for to easily identify it. After giving the patch a meaningful name, click on *OK*.
+
.Giving a name to your merged patch
image::Appendix-1-xEdit-giving-a-name-to-your-merged-patch.png[Giving a name to your merged patch, title="Giving a name to your merged patch"]
. That's it! Our new and great-looking merged patch has been created.
+
.Merged patch created
image::Appendix-1-xEdit-merged-patch-created.png[Merged patch created, title="Merged patch created"]
. It's time to save the merged patch, so exit xEdit for it to show the window with the list of created or modified files. Make sure the patch is selected and the option *Backup plugins* is not and click on *OK*.
+
.xEdit wants to save the merged patch
image::Appendix-1-xEdit-saving-merged-patch.png[xEdit wants to save the merged patch, title="xEdit wants to save the merged patch"]
. It's time to get back to MO, but... Where is my merged patch? The only indication that something has changed is the warning icon in the toolbar.
+
.Where the fuck is my merged patch?
image::Appendix-1-Mod-Organizer-where-is-my-merged-patch.png[Where the fuck is my merged patch?, title="Where the fuck is my merged patch?"]
. Generally speaking, every time you create a file in MO, it goes to the *Overwrite* special folder. Double-click on it to show its contents, at the bottom of the left pane.
+
.There is something lurking in our 'Overwrite' folder
image::Appendix-1-Mod-Organizer-there-is-something-lurking-in-overwrite.png[There is something lurking in our 'Overwrite' folder, title="There is something lurking in our 'Overwrite' folder"]
. The overwrite folder contains two elements: our merged patch and a folder named `FO3Edit Backups`, which is created every time we exit from xEdit, although we chose not to create any backup copy (it's just a minor glitch). Get rid of the folder by right-clicking on it and selecting *Delete*.
+
.Isolating the merged patch in the 'Overwrite' folder
image::Appendix-1-Mod-Organizer-isolating-merged-patch-in-overwrite.png[Isolating the merged patch in the 'Overwrite' folder, title="Isolating the merged patch in the 'Overwrite' folder"]
. Our merged patch sits alone in the *Overwrite* folder. Time to close the window.
+
.The merged patch is isolated in the 'Overwrite' folder
image::Appendix-1-Mod-Organizer-merged-patch-isolated.png[The merged patch is isolated in the 'Overwrite' folder, title="The merged patch is isolated in the 'Overwrite' folder"]
. Back to the MO main window, right-click on the *Overwrite* entry in the left pane and select *Create Mod...*.
+
.Option to create a new mod from the contents of the 'Overwrite' folder
image::Appendix-1-Mod-Organizer-creating-merged-patch-mod-option.png[Option to create a new mod from the contents of the 'Overwrite' folder, title="Option to create a new mod from the contents of the 'Overwrite' folder"]
. In the following window, give the merged patch mod the same name we gave to the `.esp` file in xEdit and click on *OK*.
+
.Giving a meaningful name to our merged patch mod
image::Appendix-1-Mod-Organizer-naming-the-merged-patch-mod.png[Giving a meaningful name to our merged patch mod, title="Giving a meaningful name to our merged patch mod"]
. Now, you just have to activate the mod in the left pane.
+
.The merged patch is activated
image::Appendix-1-Mod-Organizer-merged-patch-activated.png[The merged patch is activated, title="The merged patch is activated"]
. Although the position of the mod in the left pane is not really important, the plugin should *ALWAYS* sit at the bottom of your load order (again, above the bashed patch). Take a look at the *Plugins* tab in the right pane.
+
.The merged patch plugin sits at the bottom of your load order

== Appendix 2: How to create your own bashed patch

Bashed patches are to merged patches what skyrocketing in a Saturn V could be to the delicate fluttering around of a butterfly. You could say they play in different leagues, but it would be more accurate to say that they play completely fucking different sports, in fact.

While a merged patch is a sort of automated merge (oh, surprise) of the differences in your mod stack, a bashed patch is a compatibility patch that takes into account, for each item added in a mod, to which https://geck.bethsoft.com/index.php?title=Leveled_Item[leveled list] it should belong. It means that vendors and containers scattered around Capital Wasteland offer items in line with your level, considering the appropriate mix of items provided by the different mods in your stack.

You could play your game without a bashed patch, and you would probably didn't notice it, but for the sake of integrity, it's a good idea to have one bashed patch per profile, alongside your mod stack, including the merged patch per profile you had created/installed.

Take into account that creating a bashed patch is way more complicated than creating a merged patch. Thus, I heartedly recommend using the pre-generated bashed patches at the end of each major DEFCON chapter, although, again, you will be able to use them if and only if you have installed each and every one mod in this guide, and in the right order. This was of paramount importance regarding merged patches, and it's even *more* important regarding bashed patches.

[TIP]
====
There is a video from Michael, of GamerPoets (10:06), explaining https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1Es06MtAZM[how to generate a bashed patch for _Skyrim_] with Wrye Bash, which is very similar to Wrye Flash, the tool we have previously configured. You can also watch the video created by Cal, from DirtyWeasel (32:06), explaining https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLWMvEg2LxwXYgN9UIEFAEGxfmT5ondfIi&v=v3tPQKDStTc[how to create merged and bashed patches for _Fallout New Vegas_].
====

Part of the bashed patch creation process involves adding bash tags to certain mods in your stack. These tags are used by Wrye Flash to create the bashed patch.

Right from https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/1009349-in-boss-what-are-bash-tags-and-what-am-i-supposed-to-do/?p=8239348[this forum post written by ripple], bash tags tell Wrye Flash that:

. These mods contain edits to the default game leveled lists.
. What sort of edits they are (add, remove, or both).
. What Wrye Flash should do to merge these conflicting leveled lists into the bashed patch.

We are going to add bash tags in the following procedure, prior to the creation of the actual bashed patch.

. Open MO and switch to the *Downloads* tab in the right pane.
. We need to create a dummy bashed patch for Wrye Flash to build it. In Windows Explorer open the folder `[%FO3_HOME%\Mopy\templates]` and copy the file `Bashed Patch, 0.esp` to a location of your choice.
. Rename the copy to reflect the name of the profile you are working with (for example, `DEFCON 01 Bashed Patch.esp`).
. Create a ZIP archive (using http://www.7-zip.org/[7-Zip], for example) with this file and name it `DEFCON-01-Bashed-Patch.zip`.
. Delete the file `DEFCON 01 Bashed Patch.esp`. We are not going to need it anymore.
. Drag and drop the file `DEFCON-01-Bashed-Patch.zip` to the *Downloads* tab in MO.
+
.Sideloading the bashed patch
image::Appendix-1-Mod-Organizer-sideloading-bashed-patch.png[Sideloading the bashed patch, title="Sideloading the bashed patch"]
. Double-click on the mod entry to pull up the *Quick Install* window. Change the mod's name from "DEFCON" to "DEFCON 01 Bashed Patch" and click on *OK* (we are pretty sure that the inner structure is correct).
+
.Bashed patch Quick Install window
image::Appendix-1-Mod-Organizer-bashed-patch-Quick-Install.png[Bashed patch Quick Install window, title="Bashed patch Quick Install window"]
. The bashed patch appears in the left pane, just below our merged patch. MO does not know shit about our bashed patch, so we are going to give it a proper version number. Double-click on the mod name to show the properties window.
+
.The bashed patch is installed but not active yet
image::Appendix-1-Mod-Organizer-bashed-patch-installed-but-not-active.png[The bashed patch is installed but not active yet, title="The bashed patch is installed but not active yet"]
. In the properties window, navigate to the *Nexus Info* tab and change the version number to "1.0", clicking on *Close* afterwards.
+
.Correcting the version number of the bashed patch
image::Appendix-1-Mod-Organizer-bashed-patch-corrected-version.png[Correcting the version number of the bashed patch, title="Correcting the version number of the bashed patch"]
. Activate the bashed patch in the left pane. You will see that the corresponding plugin appears at the bottom of the *Plugins* tab, although it has a funny broom icon beside. It means MO has detected that the plugin does not do anything, so it could be removed with no effect. It is perfectly normal, because Wrye Flash has not rebuilt the plugin yet.
+
.The bashed patch is installed and active
image::Appendix-1-Mod-Organizer-bashed-patch-installed-and-active.png[The bashed patch is installed and active, title="The bashed patch is installed and active"]
. Now comes the tricky part. We are going to use LOOT to find out the missing bash tags we need to add in Wrye Flash. Open LOOT using the toolbar icon.
+
.Launching LOOT through the toolbar button
image::Appendix-1-Mod-Organizer-LOOT-toolbar-button.png[Launching LOOT through the toolbar button, title="Launching LOOT through the toolbar button"]
. LOOT uses what is called a https://github.com/loot/fallout3/blob/v0.10/masterlist.yaml[masterlist] to keep track of all the integrity details of any conceivable plugin you could have in your stack, including bash tags. Take a look to what LOOT have to say about such plugins, with a list of tags under the file name.
+
.LOOT shows the bash tags of any plugin it knows of
image::Appendix-1-LOOT-shows-bash-tags-through-masterlist.png[LOOT shows the bash tags of any plugin it knows of, title="LOOT shows the bash tags of any plugin it knows of"]
. You need to write down the bash tags LOOT points out for your entire mod stack.
. Close LOOT and get back to MO. Once there, use the toolbar icon to launch Wrye Flash.
+
.Launching Wrye Flash through the toolbar button
image::Appendix-1-Mod-Organizer-Wrye-Flash-toolbar-button.png[Launching Wrye Flash through the toolbar button, title="Launching Wrye Flash through the toolbar button"]
. Wrye Flash is a strange beast, but we will try to keep the fuss to a minimum. In the *Mods* tab, which should be selected by default, select, for example, `BrokenSteel.esm` to show its data in the right column.
+
.Wrye Flash with 'BrokenSteel.esm' selected
image::Appendix-1-Wrye-Flash-with-BrokenSteel-esm-selected.png[Wrye Flash with 'BrokenSteel.esm' selected, title="Wrye Flash with 'BrokenSteel.esm' selected"]
. At the bottom of the right column there is a pane labeled *Bash Tags*, with the tags Wrye Flash deems necessary. Wrye Flash uses an obsolete master list, so we need to adjust the values to equate them to the values we found out through LOOT. Right-click in the *Bash Tags* pane to pull up a window with all the possible bash tags you can add or remove, and unselect `Relev` (you probably have to use the small arrow at the bottom of the selection list to get there; it's a real pain in the ass, I know).
+
.Selecting bash tags in Wrye Flash
image::Appendix-1-Wrye-Flash-selecting-bash-tags.png[Selecting bash tags in Wrye Flash, title="Selecting bash tags in Wrye Flash"]
. Repeat the process for the rest of the plugins with bash tags in our list.
. Right-click on the bashed patch file (`DEFCON 01 Bashed Patch.esp`), which should be at the bottom of your load order, and select the option *Rebuild Patch...*.
+
.Option to rebuild a bashed patch in Wrye Flash
image::Appendix-1-Wrye-Flash-rebuild-patch-option.png[Option to rebuild a bashed patch in Wrye Flash, title="Option to rebuild a bashed patch in Wrye Flash"]
. Every time you rebuild a bashed patch, Wrye Flash detects if there are mods which could be deactivated because they will be, in fact, included in the bashed patch. As a rule of thumb, it is advisable to click on *Yes*.
+
.Wrye Flash suggests deactivating the merged patch
image::Appendix-1-Wrye-Flash-deactivate-suggested-mods.png[Wrye Flash suggests deactivating the merged patch, title="Wrye Flash suggests deactivating the merged patch"]
. Wrye Flash shows a window to configure the way we want to rebuild the bashed patch. First, we need to select all the items clicking on *Select All*.
+
.Selecting all rebuild configuration options in Wrye Flash
image::Appendix-1-Wrye-Flash-selecting-all-rebuild-configuration-options.png[Selecting all rebuild configuration options in Wrye Flash, title="Selecting all rebuild configuration options in Wrye Flash"]
. You may see a pop-up window with a weird error. Dismiss the window and don't look closely, for your sanity's sake.
+
.Weird error window when selecting all items in Wrye Flash
image::Appendix-1-Wrye-Flash-select-all-weird-error.png[Weird error window when selecting all items in Wrye Flash, title="Weird error window when selecting all items in Wrye Flash"]

+
.Deselecting unwanted configuration items

. We have to fine-tune certain elements. All sub-items in each category should be checked, except:
* The file corresponding to the merged patch in *Merge Patches*.
* The file `Fallout3.esm` in *Import Names*.
